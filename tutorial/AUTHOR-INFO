This file contains information for current/prospective contributors
to the Debian Tutorial.

------------------------
IMPORTANT: Your work will be placed under the FSF documentation license
and/or the GPL, and we would like to leave open the possibility of 
assigning copyright for the work to either SPI or the FSF, excluding
the parts which are copyrighted by Larry Greenfield.

YOU SHOULD HAVE READ THE GPL AND THE FSF DOCUMENTATION LICENSE, AND
BE COMFORTABLE WITH THEM. IF YOU ARE NOT, PLEASE DO NOT CONTRIBUTE
TO THIS MANUAL.

When writing it is VERY VERY important that you not refer to any document
with unknown copyright or a copyright other than the FSF documentation
license. Please do not copy even a single sentence verbatim from other 
sources. Plagiarism will get us sued and ruin the possibility 
of publishing this document. Note that trivial rewordings are not good
enough; you need to *rewrite* everything - new analogies, new structure,
new order of presentation, new content.

Thanks, and apologies that that is necessary. On to the interesting
stuff - please read this whole file.

------------------------

The files in this directory are meant to be updated by everyone. Feel
free to add your own notes to the notes files, and of course you'll
want to change the Tutorial source file.

Notes on the source file:

I'm using --- for dash, on the principle that it can be
search-and-replaced later if it's the wrong thing.

Put a FIXME when something's wrong, and we can grep for these
prior to public releases.

The chapter/section id's are hierarchical, to create "namespaces".

Emacs PSGML mode will screw up the <example></example> indentation. 
These have to stay left-justified. So you can't indent the whole
document at once, you have to dodge the <example> parts. Fill will
also screw up the <example> sections, obviously.

"Configuration" chapters (mostly toward the end) have low priority,
these are supposed to be in the Installation Manual.

If in doubt, explain it. We're not paying for paper so be thorough. :)

If you're working on a chapter or section feel free to change around,
remove, add headings.

The use of <tt> vs. <prgn> is a little inconsistent. Probably ought to
be fixed. 

<em> can be used to mark the first occurence of an important concept, 
e.g. "this part of the system is called the <em>kernel</em>"

Note the '<enumlist> <item> <p> <tt>command </tt> <p> explanation'
format for tutorials. This is vastly inferior to DocBook. For now 
we'll have to suck it up and deal.

If you make changes, please add to the ChangeLog. Emacs has a
ChangeLog mode that's nice. Otherwise copy the format of previous
entries.
