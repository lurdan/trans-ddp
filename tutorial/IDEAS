(If you just want to see a section in the Tutorial, it might be better
to add a heading to the Tutorial outline.)

-> I think Emacs comes with its own excellent docs, so I see no reason to have

-> vi, on the other hand, needs a chapter... and thankfully the LDP manual has
   one. This should definitely be used, IMO.
