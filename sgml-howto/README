To process the document, you will need the Perl modules
XML::DOM and XML::Parser. In Debian 2.2, they are the 
packages libxml-dom-perl and libxml-parser-perl. In
Debian 2.1 and before, you have to install them by hand.
They can be found in $CPAN/XML.

You will need DocBook Modular stylesheets (Debian package docbook-stylesheets)
1.46 or above (there was a bug before, which will deprive you of some 
information).
