  The /manuals.sgml/fr/ directory contains documents written in French.
  These documents reside here because they are specific to Debian in a
  French speaking environment, so there is no reason to provide an
  English (or any other language) version.

  As they are valuable for French speaking Debian users, it does make
  sense to put them under the DDP wings.
