Spanish is one of the official languages in Spain, 
the official language in most of the countries in the American 
continent and the official language in Equatorial Guinea. 
It is spoken in many other regions where it is not the 
official language. Other official languages in Spain are 
Galician, Catalan and Basque. These other languages each 
have their own specific issues with regards to Localization. 
They are not described in this section of the document.
</P>

<P>
The Spanish Language derives from the variation spoken in 
the Castille region. The term Castillian is sometimes used 
to refer to the Spanish language (particularly when an 
author wants to stress the fact that there are other 
languages spoken in Spain). Both Castillian and Spanish 
language refer to the same language, they are not 
different things.

<sect1 id="spanish-character"><heading>Characters used in Spanish</heading>

<P>
Spanish uses a Latin alphabet. The numerical characters 
used in Spanish are the Arabic numerals.
</P>

<P>
The character that distinguishes Spanish from other Latin alphabets 
is the &Ntilde; ('N' with tilde), which exists in uppercase and 
lowercase versions. Vowels in Spanish may have a mark (the accent) 
on top of them to indicate intensity intonation. This accent is 
required for orthography (written correctness) on lowercase vowels 
but it is optional in uppercase vowels. The letter 'u' may have a 
dieresis (like the German umlaut), both in uppercase and 
lowercase forms.
</P>

<P>
Some punctuation signs are characteristic of the Spanish 
language. The opening question mark and the opening 
exclamation sign look like the English question mark and 
exclamation sign rotated 180 degrees. The English question 
mark and exclamation sign are referred to as closing question 
mark and exclamation sign. The small underlined 'a' and 'o' are 
used mainly for ordinal numbers, similar to the small 'th' 
in English ordinals.

<sect1 id="spanish-sets"><heading>Character Sets</heading>

<P>
UNE (Una Norma Espa&ntilde;ola) is the National 
Standards Organization in Spain. UNE is a member of the ISO and 
standards that have one-to-one correspondence are usually 
called by their ISO number, rather than their UNE number.
</P>

<P>
ISO 8859-1, also known as ISO Latin-1, contains the characters 
required for Spanish.
</P>

<sect1 id="spanish-codesets"><heading>Codesets</heading>

<P>
The codeset mostly used for Spanish is the 
ANSI codeset (codepage Windows 1252 a.k.a. Windows Latin-1). 
Other available codesets are Unicode, EBCDIC, 
Macintosh Roman (codepage 1000), MS-DOS  Latin-1 (codepage 850) 
or less frequently MS-DOS Latin US (codepage 437) which 
does not contain accented uppercase charaters.  
They are all stateless, 8-bit codepages (with the 
exception of Unicode that is 16-bits)
</P>

<sect1 id="spanish-how"><heading>How These Codesets Are Used --- Information for Programmers</heading>

<P>
In most cases it is safe to use ANSI characters. Some exceptions are
<list>
 <item>WWW browsers should recognize all codesets. 
 <item>Software which communicates with IBM mainframes, Macintosh 
       or MS-DOS should handle the corresponding encoding 
       (EBCDIC, Macintosh Roman, Codepages 850 and 437 respectively).
 <item>File names for Joliet-format CD-ROM used for Windows is 
       written in Unicode.
</list>
</P>

<sect1 id="spanish-columns"><heading>Columns</heading>

<P>
On console displays, each character occupies one column. Printed 
text can be equally spaced (one column per character) or 
proportionally spaced (a character can occupy fractionally 
more or less than a column, depending on its shape).
</P>

<P>
Note: Even when using Traditional Sorting, ch and ll occupy 
two columns. See the comment on Traditional sorting in 
<ref id="spanish-sort">.
</P>

<sect1 id="spanish-direction"><heading>Writing Direction</heading>

<P>
Spanish is normally written in left to right lines arranged 
from top to bottom of the page. For artistic purposes it might 
be written in top to bottom columns arranged left to right 
within the page. This columnar arrangement would be expected 
only in graphic and charting programs (e.g., a drawing program, 
a spreadsheet graph or a page layout program for composing 
brochures) but regular text editors wouldn't be expected to 
implement this style. 
</P>

<sect1 id="spanish-layout"><heading>Layout of Characters</heading>

<P>
In the Spanish language, words are separated by spaces 
and a line can be broken at a space, a punctuation sign or 
a hyphenated word.
</P>

<P>
There are several sets of paired characters in Spanish. 
Unlike English, question marks and exclamation signs are 
also paired. Other paired characters are the same as English 
(parenthesis, square brackets, and so forth). Opening 
characters shouldn't appear at the end of a line. 
Closing characters and punctuation signs such as period and 
comma shouldn't appear at the beginning of a line.
</P>

<P>
Words can be broken at a syllabus and hyphenated. Unlike 
English, syllabi in Spanish end in a vowel more often than 
in a consonant. Syllabi that end in a consonant letter are 
typically at the end of a word or followed by a syllabus 
that starts with another consonant. Anyway, the rules are
not completely consistent and a hyphenation 
dictionary has to be used.

<P>
I don't know about this one :( Assistance would be appreciated.
</P>

<sect1 id="spanish-input"><heading>Input from Keyboard</heading>

<P>
Most of the Spanish characters are input from the keyboard 
with a single stroke. A two-key combination is used for accent 
and dieresis marks above vowels. Traditional typewriter 
machines used a 'dead key' system with keys that would 
strike the paper without advancing the carriage to the 
next character.  Typing on a computer keyboard simulates 
this behavior, typing the accent or dieresis key does 
not produce any visible output until a vowel is typed 
afterwards. Usually if the accent or dieresis key is followed 
by a consonant, the accent key is ignored. Accented or 
dieresis characters cannot be used for shortcut keys 
for selecting options.
</P>

<P>
The words for Yes and No are S&iacute; (the character next to S is 'i'
with acute accent) and No. We would commonly use the S and N 
keys for a S&iacute;/No choice.
</P>

<P>
Spanish keyboards usually allow for typing not only the Spanish 
accent signs, but also the accent signs in French and other 
languages (grave accent, circumflex accent, umlaut on letters 
other than the u). Other character that is typically available 
is the cedilla C (that looks like a C with a comma underneath, 
used for Catalan, Portuguese and French words, for example). 
There is a Latin-American keyboard layout that does not contain 
the grave accent and the cedilla C

<sect2 id="spanish-sort"><heading>Sorting</heading>

<P>
Traditional Spanish considered the combinations CH and LL individual 
single letters. For usage in computers, this required an additional 
effort for sorting and character counting algorithms. It was 
decided that the savings in not requiring special algorithms 
was significant enough and that it would be acceptable to treat 
them as 2 separate letters. Some software that already had 
incorporated the special sorting algorithms now allows for 
choosing between 'Traditional Spanish Sort' and 'Modern Spanish Sort'.
</P>

<P>
Accents and dieresis are ignored for sorting purposes. The 
only exception is the rare case where two words are exactly 
the same and the accent is the only difference, the word with 
the unaccented character should be sorted first. E.g., 
cami&oacute;n (c-a-m-i-o with acute accent-n), camionero, 
este, &eacute;ste (e with acute accent-s-t-e).
</P>

<P>
The &ntilde; (n with tilde) is always sorted after the n and 
before the l. It cannot be intermixed with the n.
</P>

<sect2 id="spanish-varieties"><heading>Varieties of Spanish</heading>

<P>
Spanish is spoken by a tremendous variety of people. Academics 
through the different Spanish-speaking countries realized 
that this could lead to a dismemberment of the language 
and founded the Academy of the Spanish Language. This 
academy has branches in most of the Spanish-speaking 
countries, there is a Royal Academy of the Spanish Language 
of Spain, an Academy of the Spanish Language of Mexico, 
et cetera. The members of this Academy study the local 
evolution of the languages in each country. They meet 
together to maintain a body of knowledge of what should 
be considered the Standard Spanish Language and what should 
be considered local or regional terms and slang terms. 
</P>

<P>
In most cases, software can use terms that are within the 
Standard set by the Academy. When new terms appear (e.g., 
when a new product is created that has no previous name in 
the Spanish language) each region typically starts using a 
new word. When there is one or two terms that become the 
de-facto standard, the Academy would incorporate the new 
term into the Standard. This is a very slow process and 
there will be temporary usages in different regions within 
the Spanish-speaking worlds that conflict with each other. 
Some people speak about Spain-Spanish and American-Spanish 
but most of the time it doesn't really make sense to make 
this distinction. First of all, even within America, there 
are differences between the local varieties that may be greater 
than the differences with Spain itself. E.g., Spanish as 
spoken in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina may have between 
them as much differences as each of them when compared to 
how it is spoken in Spain. A computer user in Ecuador may 
feel more comfortable overall with the terms used in Spain 
than with the terms used in Mexico (and of course, most 
comfortable with the terms used in Ecuador itself!). The 
options are to either produce one Spanish version of a 
software product that is an acceptable compromise (maybe 
not perfect) for all Spanish-speaking countries or to 
produce multiple versions to account for all the regional 
variations.
</P>

<P>
A plea to all the people who are localizing software into 
Spanish: Let's use our efforts judiciously and create one 
Spanish version and not many. Let's strive for a version 
that conforms to the Standards and that can be as widely 
accepted as possible for the areas not covered by the 
Standards. Wouldn't you rather have a new product translated, 
instead of two versions of a product where one matches your 
local variety of the language?
