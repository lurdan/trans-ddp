I needed a serial communication software to connect to BBS,
though I had a MS-DOS version.
I tried several softwares and found Minicom but
it could not display Japanese characters in kterm.
Thus I decided to modify the source of Minicom.
Though it was dirty 'quick hacking', I sent the 
patch to the upstream developer.

<P>
Minicom is written in C.
</P>

<P>
At first I explore the source code to find the way for characters
to be displayed.  I found that it implements a 'ncurses'-like
functions.
</P>

<P>
Since Minicom is used for BBS it seemed to have a conversion table
so as to IBM-PC graphics characters (I guess) can be displayed 
correctly.
I made an another pass for characters to go without any modification
and added a new command option to activate the pass.

<sect1><heading>Not to break continuity of multibyte characters</heading>

<P>
The 'ncurses'-like functions in Minicom outputs location code
every time a character is outputted.  This breaks continuity
of multibyte characters.
