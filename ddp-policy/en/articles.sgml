<chapt id="articles">Articles
<p>
This section has been created in order to provide a place for articles 
related to Debian and written by developers (or other people that want
to contribute it to the Debian Documentation Project).
</p>
<p>
Articles might, unlike manuals, get out of date and not be updated. 
The intention to have them CVS available is to provide a way to both
publish them on the WWW (like manuals are) and to server as a repository
of knowledge. Articles, even if not up-to-date, can be used to write new
articles.
</p>

<sect>Content organization
<p>
Articles are located in the DDP CVS under <file>ddp/articles/</file>.  
Each article is in its own sub-directory which contains a README 
file with:
<example>
author: Author's name
published: Where has it been published
date: date of publishing
update: date it has been last updated (usually it's the same as date:)
</example>
<p>
The documentation format in articles is, unlike that of manuals.sgml,
not standardized. Debiandoc-sgml is still preferred, but, due to its
limitation (unable to include images for example), docbook-xml can
be also used for articles here. 
<p>
In any case, articles, when possible, should be translated from their
documentation format to debiandoc-sgml. Some articles might be found, however
in linuxdoc-sgml. These articles need to be translated to debiandoc-sgml
*before* publishing is made (there are not fundamental differences between
them to justify using linuxdoc-sgml)

<sect>TODO

<list>
<item>sample Makefile for publishing (similar to the one in manuals but using
another directory)
<item>test if docbook can be compiled in debian's www machine
<item>sample Makefile for publishing using docbook-xml
