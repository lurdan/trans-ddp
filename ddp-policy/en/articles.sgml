<chapt id="articles">Articles

<p>Articles are included in the Debian Documentation Project mainly as
a way to keep for short documents related to Debian and written by 
developers (or other people that want to contribute it to the Debian 
Documentation Project). Articles are not in-depth documents (manuals are).
However, it is not uncommon for Debian developers to write articles
for magazine (online or paper-based) or to analyse a given aspect in Debian
(usually for conferences).</p>

<p>Articles can, unlike manuals, get out of date and not be updated. That
is not an issue since the knowledge they hold might be useful even
if in such state. The intention include them in the DDP and make them available
through CVS is so that it is possible to publish them on the WWW 
(like other DDP documentation) and to povide a repository
of knowledge for later use. After all, articles, even if outdate, can be
used to write new articles or might reflect an important epoch of the
Debian project.

<sect>Content organization
<p>
Articles are located in the DDP CVS under the <file>articles/</file>
directory. Each article is in its own sub-directory which
<em>must</em> contain a README file with the following information
in its header:

<example>
title: Article title
author: Author's name
published: Where has it been published (if anywhere)
date: publishing date
update: date it has been last updated (usually it's the same as date:)
</example>

<p>The documentation format in articles is, unlike that of 
<file>manuals.sgml</file>, not standardized. Debiandoc-sgml 
is still preferred, but, due to its limitation (described
previously) sometimes authors might prefer other formats 
(such as Docbook-xml or LaTeX). These can be used for articles.
However note that if the author users a format which cannot be
easily compiled on the documentation server for publishing, the DDP
might not dedicate effort to have the documents published. Formats
that can be readily compiled from source format into the publishing
formats of manuals (HTML, text, PDF and PS) have more chances of being
integrated in the publishing tool chain.

<p>For this reason, articles, when possible, should be translated from their
documentation format to the preferred format of the DDP (currently 
debiandoc-sgml). Some articles might be found, however
in linuxdoc-sgml. These articles need to be translated to debiandoc-sgml
<strong>before</strong> publishing is made. This is because 
there are no fundamental differences between both format to justify
using linuxdoc-sgml.
