<chapt id="manuals">Debian Manuals

<p>The DDP considers a <em>Debian Manual</em> to be any piece of 
documentation created to address the needs of users of Debian system 
or developers in the Debian project. </p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em>The documentation which comes with application 
software packages and installed in such places as 
<file>/usr/share/doc/<var>packagename</var>*.txt.gz</file> or
<file>/usr/share/doc/<var>packagename</var>/html/*</file> 
are not the focus of this chapter at this moment.
<p>
Debian Manuals are moving targets in the sense that they should
be constantly be updated to include relevant information related to
the object that is being documented. Some of the manuals the DDP
currently holds are:

<!-- List taken from www.debian.org/doc page -->

<item>Debiandoc-SGML Markup Manual (***)
<item>Debian SGML/XML HOWTO
</list>
</list>
<p>
Here, some documents are not directly under DDP:
<list>
<item>(*) are provided by the boot-floppies team.
<item>(**) are provided by the Debian Policy List 
  <email>debian-policy@lists.debian.org</email>.
<item>(***) are provided by the corresponding package.
<item>(****) are online versions of printed books, provided by their
  authors and the packagers.
</list>

<p>Manuals are usually of interest to a wide variety of people across
all countries and as such should be translated. This helps avoid
problems with language barriers and manages to make Debian more useful
to people all over the world.

<p>The DDP provides resources for Debian manual writers, translators
and reviewers. These resources help co-operation between all the
different people responsible to making a document available to those
that wish to read it. Thus, the framework provides:

<list>
<item>A common area for holding the sources of documentation.
<item>An automatic method for publishing documentation in the web
server (and mirrors) in different formats.
<item>An automatic method for publishing documentation in the FTP
server (and mirrors) <em>[under development]</em>.
<item>An automatic method for creating packages for the documentation
<em>[under development]</em>.
<item>An automatic method to keep track of changes between revisions
and help translators update the translated sources 
<em>[under development]</em>.
<item>A way to track requests and bug reports through the use of the
Bug Tracking System (sending bugs to the associated packages).
</list>

<p>The placeholder for the DDP manuals section in the CVS server is
the <file>manuals.sgml</file> directory. Documents under that 
directory must follow the following policies

<sect>Source file format
<p>
SGML is used as the source format for all manuals. Both
SGML format compatible with the <package>debiandoc-sgml</package>
<footnote>
The reasons for using of <em>debiandoc-sgml</em> is, among others, historical. 
When the DDP started producing documentation for Debian there was no SGML
DTD that fit the needs of the documentation team. 
<package>Linuxdoc-sgml</package>, the DTD used by the Linux Documentation
Project at the time, lacked some features, and the documentation team
decided to create it's own DTD.
</footnote>
tool chain (DTD version 1 or later) and Docbook 
<footnote>This has also been chosen by 
<url id="http://www.tldp.org" name="The Linux Documentation Project">
as its main format as described in the 
<url id="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/index.html" name="LDP Author Guide">.
</footnote>
(SGML or XML, the 4.1.2 version or later). 
For the time being the default article style 
<footnote>
Note that there currently is no stylesheet made by the DDP to 
build  documents in the right way (tm). Volunteers for this task should 
<url id="mailto:debian-doc@lists.debian.org" name="contact the debian-doc mailing list">.
</footnote>
might need to be used.

<p>Note: To translate from debiandoc-sgml format to docbook-xml please
<!--
use the tools available at
<url id="http://www.teaser.fr/~pbatailler/Debiandoc2docbookxml.tar.gz">.
<url id="http://people.debian.org/~osamu/debian-docbook/">
-->
obtain and install latest tool from DDP CVS by:
<example>
 $ cd $HOME
 $ echo 'export PATH="~/Debiandoc-to-docbook:${PATH}"'>> ~/.bash_profile
 $ . ~/.bash_profile
 $ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-doc
 $ cvs login
 $ cvs co -d Debiandoc-to-docbook utils/debiandoc-to-docbook
 $ cd Debiandoc-to-docbook
 $ cd /some/debiandoc/sgml/source-directory/   # use of mc is easy way :)
</example>
This script translates from <em>debiandoc-sgml</em> to 
<em>docbook-xml</em> with an XSLT stylesheet.
Please read <tt>README</tt> and <tt>dd3xml.html</tt> in this archive
for the details.
</p>

<p>When to you use which format? Docbook needs not be the chosen
always as the only documentation format. <em>Debiandoc-sgml</em>
is preferred for most manuals since:
<list>
<item>it's simpler (46 elements versus 300+) and thus easier to use.
<item>output is (currently) better for some purposes, it is also
more consistent (due to simplicity of the DTD).
<item>it's a tool that has been used for all previous Debian) manuals.
</list>

<P>However, the <em>debiandoc-sgml</em> DTD does have some drawbacks
including:

<list>
<item>it is not possible to include images
(see <url id="http://bugs.debian.org/140684" name="Bug #140684">)
or tables 
(see <url id="http://bugs.debian.org/141727" name="Bug #141727">)
<item>it is not internationalized completely
(see <url id="http://bugs.debian.org/31266" name="Bug #31266">)
<item>there are some layout issues when generating some formats.
</list>

<p>So, stick with <em>debiandoc-sgml</em> unless you need
tables, figures, optional framed output and such.

<p>The other options for the source file format were: 
LaTeX, HTML, texinfo, groff and several other 
minor formats. Even if some of these were used at some point by DDP
documents their use is not supported. <em>All</em> DDP manuals must
be provided either in <em>debiandoc-sgml</em> or 
<em>docbook</em> (sgml or xml) format (this rule does not necessarily
apply to other documentation that is handled by the DDP)</p>

<sect>How to start a manual
<p>If you think a manual is missing in the Debian Documentation
Project and want to contribute writing it first (or have it
already written) please follow this procedure:

<list>
<item>read this policy first (you are obviously in the right track,
aren't you?)
<item>contact the DDP (through the 
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc" name="mailing list">)
and post there the document you want to start working on.
<item>before creating a new manual, consider if your new documentation
can be integrated into a previous manual (as a new chapter, for example).
Also consider taking up the maintainership of an orphaned manual if it's
similar to the one you want to work in.
<item>ask for <url id="http://cvs.debian.org/?cvsroot=debian-doc" name="CVS access">
to the DDP area
<footnote>If you are a Debian developer you will access it through
the <em>:ext:ssh</em> method, otherwise a <em>pserver</em> account 
will be created for you</footnote>
<item>(once the document compiles properly) ask for it to be published under
the <url id="www.debian.org/doc/manuals" name="web server documentation">.
<item>(once you want to make public the document) ask the web team to provide
a link to the document from the <url id="http://www.debian.org/doc/ddp" name="DDP pages">.
<item>create new packages (preferably using <package>cvs-buildpackage</package>)
and submit it to the debian upload queue.
<item>ask for translations at the 
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/" name="internationalization mailing list">
(and keep track of those that volunteered as translators)
<item>attend to bugs either sent directly to your mail address (if published in
the document's author field), through the BTS (if packages are available)
or through the appropriate mailing lists (you should subscribe to 
the <url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc" name="DDP mailing list">,.
</list>

<sect>How are documents published?

<p>Documents under the <file>manuals.sgml</file> are compiled 
and published through a chain of <file>Makefile</file>s. The Makefile
under the root dir includes a definition of which subdirectories
will be handled in the chain. This makes the Makefile go through
each of the subdirs and compile the documents. 

<p>All documents must hold a <file>Makefile</file> in the main
directory. Contents of this Makefile <strong>must</strong> be derived
from the ones included in the <file>Makefile.common</file>, this file
includes common definitions (such as <em>publish</em>) which will
be used when compiling and common variables (such as the place where
to install the compiled documentation) that should not be modified.

<p>Following make target are used:
<list>
<item>all: build all formats within the source directory
<item>publish: publish all web contents to the PUBLISHDIR
<item>publish-ftp: publish all FTP contents to the PUBLISHDIR (proposed)
<item>clean: clean files which all target created
<item>distclean: clean files which all, publish, and publish-ftp
 target created
</list>

<p>Following make variables are used:
<list>
<item>PUBLISHDIR: root of the directory where files are installed.
 The value provided by the higher level Makefile shall override 
 one defined in the Makefile.
</list>

<sect>Published file formats

<p>In order to provide readers for different methods to access
documentation, we strive to publish contents in all the following 
formats:

<list>
 <item>HTML. This format is required and necessary for publishing 
 documents in different media. This format allows users to browse
 the web server's documentation, the CD documentation, etc. using
 any web browser of their choice. For long documents it is preferred
 to divide into multiple files (this is done automatically by 
 <em>debiandoc-sgml</em>) in order to browse more easily through
 different chapters (allows for faster downloads).</p>

 <item>Plain text. This format is also required since it's the most
 portable across any environment. It is also best used for using
 simple (a.k.a <em>grep</em>) and complex (documentation
 databases) methods to find information on documentation. Manuals
 provided in plain text must be compiled into a single file.

 <item>Postscript (PS). This is an optional format, it allows 
 <em>pretty printing</em> of documents in Postcript-enabled printers
 and is sometimes better for reading under some environments. Postcript
 is sometimes associated with Unix-like environments (but there are also
 Postcript tools for others). It has been currently displaced, however, by
 the PDF format. Documents in Postcript format are provided in a single
 file.

 <item>Adobe's PDF format. This is also an optional format, however,
 the PDF format has received widespread use in unix and non-unix environments.
 Documents in PDF format are used to print the document or to read the
 document on-screen, since it's usually possible to provide better formatting
 within this environment. It's also a single file format.

</list>

<sect>File names and their locations
<p>
In the following section, the choice of the file names and their 
locations are explained.  Here following conventions are used:

<list>
<item><tt>&manualname;</tt> is the generic name of the manual without 
language specification (it is most likely the source package name).

<item><tt>&langname;</tt> is the language specification and uses
the same convention as the apache auto-language selection 
(<tt>en, fr, it, de, pt-br, ...</tt>).

<item><tt>&localename;</tt> is the locale specification and uses
the same convention as the <package>glibc</package>.
<p>
<em>FIXME:</em>I can not find short version of 
locale "en" or "fr" anyway:
<tt>en, fr, it, de, pt_BR, ...</tt> or should be like full description
such as en_US.UTF8.
</list>

<sect1>Upstream SGML source
<p>
DDP run CVS server and keep upstream SGML source (or its copy).
<example>
  CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-doc 
  Repository: ddp/manuals.sgml/&manualname;/
</example>
<p>
After obtaining consensus in <email>debian-doc@lists.debian.org</email>
one can start new directory as follows:
<example>
$ cd <var>someplace</var>
$ CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-doc
$ export CVSROOT
$ cvs co ddp/manuals.sgml/
$ cd ddp/manuals.sgml/
$ mkdir <var>new-ddp-manual-name</var>
$ cvs add <var>new-ddp-manual-name</var>
$ cvs ci
...
</example>
</p>

<sect1>Debian packages
<p><em>FIXME:</em> write about why you need to make Debian
packages. And also how to make them easily.

<sect2>Source packages

<p>The Source package contains the SGML source only

<list>
<item>Option 1:
<list>
<item>&packagename;_<var>version</var>_all.tar.gz
<item>&packagename;_<var>version</var>_all.dsc
</list>
<item>Option 2
<list>
<item>&packagename;_<var>version</var>_all.tar.gz
<item>&packagename;_<var>version-buildversion</var>_all.diff.gz
<item>&packagename;_<var>version-buildversion</var>_all.dsc
</list>
</list>
<p>The latter format is preferred even if you are the upstream maintainer.</p>
<p>
If the source consists of multiple files, you are
encouraged to keep them in one specific subdirectory per language.
</p>

<p><em>FIXME</em>: Adam believes that it could be possible to
distribute the SGML source _only_ and creating the formats 
the user wants to have at runtime (could be installation time 
as well as afterwards). This has several advantages:
<list>
<item> the .debs would be small
<item>greatest flexibility
<item>it could be possible even adjust links when compiling 
the docs, i.e. replacing Internet links to local ones if 
the files are present !!!
<item> it's probably easier to keep an overall index 
page up-to-date (a la dwww)
</list>
<p>Some disadvantages are:
<list>
<item> people need to have debiandoc-sgml installed (but that's not big)
<item> formatting will take a few seconds (not too much but simply unpackaging would be faster) 
</list>
<P>This has also been discussed recently (see
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2002/debian-doc-200212/msg00097.html">)
</p>

</sect2>

<sect2>Binary package: 
<p>
The Binary package provides the documents in each of the
proposed formats for offline reading. Binary packages should
include all the formats for which the document compiles.
As for translations, they should be provided as separate packages
if the binary (with all the available translations) exceeds
five megabytes in size (see below for the appropriate naming
for these binary packages).</p>
<p>Depending on whether or not translations are provided
in different binary packages the package naming will be:

<list>
<item>A single &packagename;_<var>version</var>_all.deb package
which holds the english original (and all the translations if any).

<item>If there are multiple binary packages:
<list>
<item>One &packagename;-&langname;_<var>version</var>_all.deb for
every translation available (including english)
<item>A virtual package &packagename;_<var>version</var>_all.deb
that depends on all of the available translated (and original)
versions.
</list>
</list>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> this is debatable. Currently
many package name  &packagename;_<var>version</var>_all.deb 
just install the English original. Some people feel that the
use of the name for the English package,
&packagename;-en_<var>version</var>_all.deb should be discouraged.</p>

</sect2>

<sect1>Files installed by the Debian package (Option1)
<p>
In order to make DDP documents easy to find, use of
<tt>&filehome;/</tt> has been adopted as the central location.
Currently this file location is under discussion.

<list>
<item>Index page (optional, auto generated):

<item><tt>&dochome;/&packagename;-&langname;/html</tt> should point 
to <tt>&filehome;/&manualname;/&langname;/html/</tt> (as a symlink).
This is because we need to have (per policy) the 
<tt>&packagename;-&langname;</tt> directory if we are going to make

this so explicitly. Osamu)

<sect1>Files on FTP server

<p>DDP documents need to be published in Debian's ftp servers
(and mirrors) in order to provide another mean for retrieval to 
users. The placeholder for this documentation is
<url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/doc/">
</p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> Determine how this is going to be automated
(contact ftp-masters). The <file>/doc</file> should be handled
exclusively by the DDP team.

<p><em>FIXME:</em> this is an idea (Osamu). Permissions, etc. need
to be fixed too.

<p>FTP files are created with <tt>publish-ftp</tt> target in top most
<file>Makefile</file> which uses <tt>publish</tt> target in

<sect>Files on CD-ROM ISO images

<p><em>FIXME:</em> This needs to be more homogeneous.

<p>The current <package>debian-cd</package> program is used to build
the ISO images for official Debian CD-ROMs. This program extracts 
documentation to be placed in the CD-ROMs so that users can access
this documentation without needing to install Debian at all (even
if later on they could install the same documentation just by
installing the appropriate packages).

<p>Not all DDP documents are placed on the CD-ROMs since once of the
issues on these ISO images is how to distribute the available size
so that all the necessary software is available in the first CD-ROMs
(so that users do not need to download all the CD-ROMs in order
to have a functioning Debian installation). Thus, only important
documentation (usually oriented towards users) is placed there.
This usually includes documents such as: The Debian FAQ, 
The Installation Manual, etc.

<p><em>FIXME:</em> Check if this is true.  Also for text, 
directory are better to use full locale such as en_US.UTF-8/
which is not the case in Debian.</p>

<p><package>Debian-cd</package> takes the available documentation from
different sources: the primary FTP server and some documentation 
packages installed in the system where the script is run. 

<p>Note: Providing a sensible location of documentation in the 
packages as well as translations makes it possible to have 
<package>debian-cd</package> make localized CD-ROMs that not only
include the installation in a given language but provide the documentation
in that language too!

<p>This section describes few recommended practices but these are not an
enforced part of the DDP policy.</p>

<sect1>index.html
<p>
Currently, many generated HTML files still create index.html or 
index.&langname;.html as the starting page but these are discouraged 
practices since they hide other files. (<em>FIXME:</em> This is 
debatable.  It is implemented for the Debian Reference but makefile 
is a mess.)
</p>
</sect1>

<sect1>Debian web page entry style
<p>
<file>user-manuals.wml</file> entry shall be:
<example>
&lt;availability&gt;
&lt;released name="<var>release-name</var>" path="<var>path-in-web-site</var>"&gt;
&lt;inpackage "<var>package-name</var>"&gt;
&lt;released name="<var>package-name</var>" index="<var>index-name</var>" path="<var>package-location</var>"
              langs="en fr it es" formats="html txt pdf ps"&gt;
&lt;inddpcvs name="<var>cvs-location</var>" langs="en pt-br ru" cvsname="<var>cvs-name</var>"&gt;
&lt;/availability&gt;
</example>
<p>
For packages which has released version, use "released" instead of "inddpcvs"
to create the web page.
</p>
</sect1>

<sect1>LaTeX/TeX
<p>
In order to reliably produce PS and PDF files, it is recommended to
include a <file>texmf/texmf.cnf</file> file which <strong>only</strong>
lists those key parameters (i.e., things like pool_size) which you need
to have them large enough for the proper building environment.
</p>
<p>
Then Makefile has to use it through the environment variable:
<example>
TEXMFCNF=texmf:
export TEXMFCNF
</example>
Here, the trailing colon is critical. This will ensure rest of parameters to
be taken from the system's current default value and avoids TeX version
dependencies for the SGML source as well prevents FTBFS bug problems.
</p>
<p>
If you are running specifically LaTeX, then you may want to have:
<example>
pool_size.latex = <var>whatever</var>
</example>
to specify that you want it to apply to LaTeX; otherwise a specific
one in the <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf</file> file might override yours.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can also specify pool_size etc. as environment
variables, which will override the texmf.cnf settings.
