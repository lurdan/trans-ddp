<chapt id="common">Common policy for documentation

<sect>Responsible party
<p>Documents must be maintained by at least one <em>Author</em>.
If the author is unavailable and nobody steps up to keep maintaining
its manuals they might be considered <em>Orphaned</em> and treated
as such (could be removed from publishing if its contents get too
much out-of-date). Also, optionally there might be many <em>Translators</em>.
</p>
<p>Interested translators are encouraged to contact first the author of a
document and then, if it exists, the localization team for the language
the translator wants to translate too. This helps authors keep track
of who is translating the document (in case somebody else volunteers)
and also prevents for duplicate effort (maybe somebody in the localization
team is currently translating it and has not contacted the main author).
</p>

<sect>License

<p>All documention of the Debian Documentation Project (DDP) must be
released under a free license (free to use, modify and distribute).
<footnote>
Note that there is currently disagreement regarding wether or not
documentation can be asked to be <em>free in the DFSG sense</em>.
Arguably, the DFSG does not really apply to documentation since 
they are free <strong>software</strong> guidelines. Some other people
think there is not really any distinction between documentation and 
software. The debate on this have not finished yet but it may be
worthwhile reading the thread at debian-legal
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/debian-legal-200306/msg00100.html" name="Proposed: Debian's Five Freedoms for Free Works">.
</footnote>
for the Debian project to use. This is true not only for documentation provided
by the DDP authors themselves but for documentation provided in the Debian
operating system by packages (including FAQs, manpages, help pages, etc.).</P>


<P>The <em>recommended</em> license for any (new) document in Debian is the
GNU General Public License
<footnote>For more information refer to this
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/1998/debian-doc-199809/msg00005.html"
name="thread on the debian-doc mailing list">.
</footnote>
More often than not, documentation is directly dependant to software used
by Debian and thus has to be modified under the same conditions. This applies
to technical documentation that is related to software. It might not fully
apply to other kind of documents, but since documentation licenses are at
still at their infancy (most are under heavy discussion) the GPL is preferred
since documentation which uses it is clearly <em>free</em> in the DFSG sense.
</p>

<p>Note however that some documentation licenses are acceptable too, granted
that they do not impose unnecessary restrictions:

<list>

<item>The <url id="http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html" 
name="FreeBSD Documentation License"> is acceptable. Just make sure that you 
adapt it to your document by changing the project name and the source format.

<item>The Linux Documentation Project (LDP)
<url id="http://www.tldp.org/COPYRIGHT.html" name="Linux Documentation Project License v2.0"> is
acceptable (as discussed in the 
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0305/msg00282.html"
name="debian-legal mailing list">), notice that this is not the same as
the boilerplate license suggested in the 
<url id="http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html" name="TLDP manifesto"> which
is, on it's own, non-free because it requires new versions to be sent to the
TLDP.

<item><url id="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/pdl.pdf" name="Sun's documentation license"> 
(used by OpenOffice) is also acceptable (as discussed in the
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/debian-legal-200208/msg00267.html"
name="debian-legal mailing list">)

</list>

<p>There is not yet a full consensus for the following licenses and 
document authors are recommended not to use them:

<list>

<item>The <url id="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/" name="Open Publication License (OPL)"> 
even if none of the license options 
<footnote>
Some people think that some sections, such as IV.2, IV.4 and IV.5 might
be too restrictive, and IV.3 might be more specific than needed. However,
this license was discussed in the debian-legal mailing list in

are exercised.
</list>

<p>The following licenses are <em>not</em> recommended since the
current consensus is that they are not DFSG-free:

<list>
<item>The <url id="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html" name="GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)">
In a <url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/debian-devel-announce-200308/msg00017.html" name="survey"> done in the debian-legal 
mailing list most respondents (Debian Developers and non-Debian Developers) 
answered that this license cannot be considered DFSG-free. 
Even if some people consider it acceptable provided that
there are no Cover Texts or Invariant sections (the 
<url id="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-howto-opt.html" name="optional features">) documents under this license might not be considered by
many Debian developers completely <em>free</em>.

) wether or not Debian should have guidelines for material which 
is <strong>not</strong> software. Debian currently does not have such 
guidelines and thus discussion of licensing as related to non-software content 
should be taken to the debian-legal mailing list, except for documentation 
specific licenses which should be discussed at debian-doc first (before going 
to debian-legal).
