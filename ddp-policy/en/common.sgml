<chapt id="common">Common policy for documentation

<sect>Responsible party
<p>Documents must be maintained by at least one <em>Author</em>.
If the author is unavailable and nobody steps up to keep maintaining
its manuals they might be considered <em>Orphaned</em> and treated
as such (could be removed from publishing if its contents get too
much out-of-date). Also, optionally there might be many <em>Translators</em>.
</p>
<p>Interested translators are encouraged to contact first the author of a
document and then, if it exists, the localisation team for the language
the translator wants to translate too. This helps authors keep track
of who is translating the document (in case somebody else volunteers)
and also prevents for duplicate effor (maybe somebody in the localisation
team is currently translating it and has not contacted the main author).
</p>

<sect>License

<p>All documention of the Debian Documentation Project (DDP) must be
released under DFSG-compliant licenses. This is usually the GPL. More
often than not, documentation is directly dependant to software used
by Debian and thus has to be modified under the same conditions.
</p>

<p>Note however that some documentation licenses are acceptable too, granted
that they do not impose unnecessary restrictions.</p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> GFDL is acceptable if it does not ????</p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> Add links to mailing list discussions regarding 
documentation licenses (both in debian-doc and debian-legal).
