<chapt id="common">Common policy for documentation

<sect>Responsible party
<p>Documents must be maintained by at least one <em>Author</em>.
If the author is unavailable and nobody steps up to keep maintaining
its manuals they might be considered <em>Orphaned</em> and treated
as such (could be removed from publishing if its contents get too
much out-of-date). Also, optionally there might be many <em>Translators</em>.
</p>
<p>Interested translators are encouraged to contact first the author of a
document and then, if it exists, the localisation team for the language
the translator wants to translate too. This helps authors keep track
of who is translating the document (in case somebody else volunteers)
and also prevents for duplicate effor (maybe somebody in the localisation
team is currently translating it and has not contacted the main author).
</p>

<sect>License

<p>All documention of the Debian Documentation Project (DDP) must be
released under a free license (free to use, modify and distribute)
<footnote>
Note that there is currently disagreement regarding wether or not
documentation can be asked to be <em>free in the DFSG sense</em>.
Arguably, the DFSG does not really apply to documentation since 
they are free <strong>software</strong> guidelines. Some other people
think there is not really any distinction between documentation and 
software. The debate on this have not finished yet.
</footnote>
for the Debian project to use. This is true not only for documentation provided
by the DDP authors themselves but for documentation provided in the Debian
operating system by packages (including FAQs, manpages, help pages, etc..)</P>


<P>The chosen license is usually GNU's GPL.
<footnote>For more information refer to this
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/1998/debian-doc-199809/msg00005.html"
name="thread on the debian-doc mailing list">.
</footnote>
More often than not, documentation is directly dependant to software used
by Debian and thus has to be modified under the same conditions. This applies
to technical documentation that is related to software but might not
apply to other kind of documents.
</p>

<p>Note however that some documentation licenses are acceptable too, granted
that they do not impose unnecessary restrictions:

 is acceptable provided that there are no Cover Texts or Invariant sections
<footnote>
This has been an issue discussed many times on the debian-legal and
debian-doc mailing list. Even if some authors believe Invariant
sections do make sense the general consensus is that documents without
them can be considered <em>free</em>. Relevant discussions 
(sorted chronologically, updated as of december 2002) are:

is <strong>not</strong> sofwtare. Debian currently does not have such guidelines
and thus discussion of licensing as related to non-software content should be
taken to the debian-legal mailing list, except for documentation specific licenses
which should be discussed at debian-doc first (before going to debian-legal).
