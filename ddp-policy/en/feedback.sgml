<sect>Bug report protocols for the DDP
<p>
Bug report should be files to the Debian Documentation Project List,
<email>debian-doc@lists.debian.org</email> if the particular document 
is not packaged as a Debian package.  If a BTS entry for the package
exist, you are highly encouraged to file a bug to the package.
It is recommended to send translation-related bugs against the particular
&packagename;-&langname; package instead of the source package itself.</p>

<p>Please avoid sending bug reports (or requests) to the document
maintainers directly. Maintainers are already subscribed to the BTS
and sending them the bugs directly only increases that chances that
the mail might get lost (forgotten, deleted accidentaly) if the
maintainer is managing a big mailbox 
<footnote>which will unfortunately include
usually also a lot of spam due to his name being published in many
places and making it a target for mail harversters :-( </footnote>
Also, your requests and suggestions might be
lost if the document switches maintainers (due to inactivity, lack
of time or any other reason).</p>

<p>Also, please do not send bugs regarding documentation
to the debian-doc mailing list unless you want to discuss some issue
before submitting a bug report. After all, the Bug Tracking system is
better suited to track bugs (it was designed for that). 
ou can, using the BTS, receive a report when the bug is fixed and 
a new document version is released.</p>

<p>Documentation maintainers and active authors <em>should be</em> subscribed
to the Bug Tracking System for the source packages that generate the 
documentation (if they are not packaging the documents themselves). 
Translators <em>must</em> be subscribed to the BTS 
for the translated package versions.
</p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> add links to PTS and QA web page to explain how to
subscribe to debian packages when you are not the maintainer.</p>

<p>The bug report should follow standard Debian bug styles.</p>
<p><em>FIXME:</em> add link to BTS documentation.</p>

<p>In order to clarify the types of report, use of following words
at the start of the subject line is encouraged.</p>

<list>
<item>policy: policy compliance issues
<item>errata: errata information on document content
<item>patch: errata or additional information with patch
<item>request: request for additional information or clarification
<item>...
</list>

<p>Any bug report which falls into "request" must be filed with 
"priority: wishlist".</p>


<p>Bug reporters are encouraged to provide the diff file to the source files
such as SGML or XML but the diff file to the generated plain text file 
is accepted by the document maintainers as an alternative.  
This means that users do not have to learn SGML to submit changes to 
our documents. When creating diff files, please use "-u" option.
<footnote>This makes it easier for the maintainer to apply the patch
in case the document has changes a lot since the reader read it and
reported the bug with a patch. Many documents are <em>moving targets</em>
and might change quite a lot from one reader to another</footnote></p>

<p>If you are not sure on how to make diff files, please submit bugs 
indicating clearly the location of the errata (usually citing text 
in the document).  Otherwise it's more difficult for
documentation maintainers to determine what exactly needs to be fixed.</p>

<sect>Bug report protocols for the WNNP (proposal)

<p><em>FIXME:</em> This is a proposal to use the WNPP also for documentation
</p>

<p>You can make use of the <url id="http://wnpp.debian.org" name="WNPP">
to ask for documentation on a specific topic that you think it's needed.
Document maintainers can also use the WNPP to submit information on 
documentation under development or that it's going to be orphaned.</p>

<p>The following tags of the WNPP are appropiate for this task:</p>

<list>

<item><em>O</em>: as the package equivalent, this means that the author
intents to orphan a given set of documentation.

<item><em>ITA</em>: as the package equivalent, this means that the author
intents to adopt a given set of documentation.

<item><em>RFD</em> (Request for Documentation): a user that detects that
a given document (manual or other) on a given topic is not yet available
on the DDP can ask for it using this tag. DDP members will give priority
when deciding which documents need to be written to requests on a given
document by a number of users.

<item><em>ITD</em> (Intend to Document): a documentation maintainer that
is going to start writting a document. The use of the WNPP for avoids
people duplicating effort writing the same documentation.

<item><em>ITT</em> (Intend to Translate): a translator is going to start
translating a document. As above, this tries to prevent duplicate
efforts.

</list>

<p>Usually a RFP changes into a ITD when someone starts working on the
document. When closed it means that the document has been created and
is available in the DDP. It will keep this way until it's orphaned
(O) and a new maintainer (ITA) appears again. The same would happen
for translations of the document into any given language.
Thus, a normal document would follow the documentation process
shown below:
</p>

<example>
RFD---->ITD----->(document maintained/updated)------->O 
              |               ^                       |
              |               |                       |
	      |           (first commit)----ITA<-------
	      |
	      ---> ITT ---> (translation update) ---->O
                              ^                       |
                              |                       |
	                  (first commit)----ITA<-------
</example>
