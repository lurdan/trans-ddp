<sect>Bug report protocols for the DDP
<p>
Bug report should be files to the Debian Documentation Project List,
<email>debian-doc@lists.debian.org</email> if the particular document 
is not packaged as a Debian package.  If BTS entry for the package
exist, it is highly encouraged to file a bug to the package.
It is recommended to send translation-related bugs against the particular
&packagename;-&langname; package instead of the source package itself.
<p>
Documentation maintainers and active authors are subscribed to the bug 
tracking system of the source packages generated with the documentation.
Translators must also be subscribed to the BTS for the translated package
versions.

<p>
The bug report should follow standard Debian bug styles.
<p>
In order to clarify the types of report, use of following words
at the start of the subject line is encouraged.
<list>
<item>policy: policy compliance issues
<item>errata: errata information on document content
<item>patch: errata or additional information with patch
<item>request: request for additional information or clarification
<item>...
</list>
Any bug report which falls into "request" must be filed with 
"priority: wishlist".  
<p>
Please do not send bugs regarding documentation
to the debian-doc mailing list unless you want to discuss some issue
before submitting a bug report. Also avoid sending bugs to the
documentation's maintainer mail address, since the Bug Tracking system is
better suited to track bugs. Otherwise, your requests and suggestions might be
lost if the document switches maintainers. You can also, using the BTS,
see when the bug is fixed and a new document version is released.
<p>
Bug reports are encouraged to provide the diff file to the source files
such as SGML or XML but the diff file to the generated plain text file 
is accepted by the document maintainers as an alternative.  
This means that users do not have to learn SGML to submit changes to 
our documents.  When creating diff files, please use "-u" option. 
</p>
<p>
If you are not sure on how to make diff files, please submit bugs 
indicating clearly the location of the errata (usually citing text 
in the document).  Otherwise it's more difficult for
documentation maintainers to determine what exactly needs to be fixed.
