<chapt id="manpages">Manpages

<p><em>FIXME:</em> Explain why manpages are part of the DDP</p>
<p><em>FIXME:</em> Describe the use of the DDP CVS for manpages and
their translations.</p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> Is there a way to detect manpages changes such
as there is for the wml web pages?</p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> Are we going to provide a framework for translating
and updating non-Debian manpages?</p>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> Are we going to provide localized manpages 
together with programs or in a single package (i.e. manpages-es
is useful?). How is coordination going to be done with other
projects?</p>
