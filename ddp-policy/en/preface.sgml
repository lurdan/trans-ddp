<chapt id="preface">Preface
<p>
This is still a working version of document and many parts need work:
I indicated them with === XXX FIXME XXX ===.

<sect>Scope
<p>
The Debian Documentation Project (DDP) was formed to coordinate and unify all
efforts to write more and better documentation for the Debian system.
<p>
This manual describes packaging and publishing policy as it relates to
creating Debian packages and the DDP web sites. It is not a tutorial on how 
to build packages, nor is it exhaustive where it comes to describing
the behavior of the packaging system.
</p>
<p>
The scope of documentation for the DDP includes:
<list>
<item>manuals (long reference manual document)
<item>articles (short text articles ???)
<item>presentations (magic point slides)
<item>manpages (unix manual pages) 
<item>...
</list>

</sect>

<sect>New versions of this document
<p>
The current version of this document is available from the DDP as 
<url id="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/ddp-policy/">.
=== XXX FIXME XXX ===
</p>
<p>
The current source version of this document is available from the 
CVS:

<example>
$ CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-doc

In addition, this manual is distributed via the Debian package
<package>ddp-policy</package>.
=== XXX FIXME XXX ===
</p>
</sect>

<sect>Feedback to this policy
<p>
As the Debian GNU/Linux system is continuously evolving this
manual does so too.
</p>
<p>
While the authors of this document have tried hard to avoid
typos and other errors, these do still occur. If you discover
an error in this manual or if you want to give any
comments, suggestions, or criticisms please send an email to
the Debian Documentation Project List,
