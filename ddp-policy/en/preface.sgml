<chapt id="preface">Preface
<p>
This document is still under development and many chapters are to
be written (TBW). Sections which need work, either to write them
down or get to consensus by all documentation members are marked with
<em>FIXME</em>.

<sect>Scope
<p>
The Debian Documentation Project (it is usually called DDP for short) 
was formed to coordinate and unify all efforts that relate to documentation
in the Debian project. This includes the documentation associated with 
the Debian GNU/Linux (or other) distributions, as well as documentation 
related to the internals of the project.
</p>
<p>
This manual describes the established policy on how documents are to be
hadled within the Debian project (<em>documents</em> in a broad scope,
it's not just manuals). This includes how to contribute documents,
how to package them for inclusion in Debian distributions and how they
are published either at the Debian web site, ftp site (or 
associated mirrors) and even CD images of Debian distributions.
Even if packages are involved (since it's the mechanism for distributing
any piece of data in a Debian distribution) it is not a tutorial on how
to build packages and it will not go into lengths describing how the 
packaging system works.
</p>

<p>The DDP covers a broad range of documentation that is related to the Debian 
project. Some of the documentation might be handled by people who are
not directly in the DDP, but who maintain a set of documentation. To
make it short the DDP might be considered a reduced version of the
famous phrase cutting it into: <em>all your documents are belong to us</em>.
That is, any and all document that is either prepared or supported
by the Debian project (included in the distribution, published in the
web site) is managed through the DDP. This includes:

<list>
<item><em>Manuals</em>. Which are long documents used as reference for
a given task. Some of these documents are prepared by groups that develop
the piece of Debian they relate to (for example, the Installation Manual
is managed by the boot-floppies team).

<item><em>Manpages</em>. The unix <manref name="man" section="1"> pages
that are part of the Debian distribution, including those related to
software (or general system information) particular to a Debian GNU/Linux
system.
<item><em>Articles</em>. The DDP is also the maintainer and placeholder of
articles written by members of the Debian project, these articles are usually
short documents (and limited in scope) and might get out-of-date easier.
<item><em>Slides</em>. Such as those used in presentations given by Debian
developers. The DDP keeps these presentations since they are usually useful
to many more developers than those that originally wrote them.
</list>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> even if the web team works aside of the DDP team (there
are some people in both teams), there are some documents that originate
from the web server and are published there first. Maybe it should be
necessary to add a chapter regarding the web team and their tools?

<p>Of course, Debian <em>feeds</em> itself of many documentation that is
beyond the scope of the Debian project itself. An example of this might
be UNIX manpages for common (GNU) programs, info manuals, external 
documentation (such as the Linux Documentation Project's HOWTOs) and many
other documentation that is typically included in a Debian distribution.
Even if it would be good to provide a common framework for all of these,
many of them are already part of other projects that provide their own
setups for producing documentation (including publishing formats, 
translations, etc.). As such, the DDP tries to lay a common framework on
how this information should be installed, and, if needed, provides resources
to cooperate with these external projects.
