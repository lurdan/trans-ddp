Purpose
-------
This is the placeholder of the Debian Documentation Project
Policy document please, before making any changes (once
the Policy has been stabilised which it currently has not)
discuss it in the debian-doc mailing list.

Of course this does not apply to typo fixes, URLs, etc.

File arrangement
----------------
(Osamu)

The file arrangement of this document provides a clean file
organization of chapters that makes translation easier. Even
if translations might not be a good idea for this document
(since many DDP authors will be using the english version
in any case) it's still a good example on how to arrange chapters.
