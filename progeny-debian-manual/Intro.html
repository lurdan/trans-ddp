<A NAME="pgfId-1062179"></A>Introducing Progeny Debian</H1>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1053737"></A>Progeny Debian is a version of the Debian <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gnu</EM>
/Linux operating system. The <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
cd</EM>
s that come with this manual contain not only a complete operating system, but also the tools for most computing needs.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054883"></A> If you want an even larger selection of software, you can download it for free from the Progeny web site (http://www.progeny.com/download) or Debian web site (www.debian.org).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054874"></A>This manual is designed to get started with Progeny Debian. It is also designed for use in front of your computer.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054886"></A>The manual does not assume that you are an expert. However, it does assume that you have used computers before, and want to transfer your skills to Linux. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1055986"></A>At the very least, you are assumed to be willing to learn. Linux tools have come a long way in the last few years, but Linux is still built with a do-it-yourself philosophy. While you can ignore this philosophy, adapting it can bring a sense of power and control to your computing.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054877"></A>If you master this manual, you will still not be an expert. To cover Linux completely requires hundreds of pages. However, you should be able to configure the basic parts of your system and be ready to explore Linux on your own.</P>
<DIV>
<H3 CLASS="Heading1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054581"></A><A NAME="marker-1070906"></A>Learning About Linux</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054582"></A>Linux is an operating system: a series of programs that let you interact with your computer and run other programs. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054644"></A>Linux is modelled on the <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
unix</EM>
 operating system. From the start, Linux was designed to be a multi-tasking, multi-user system. These facts are enough to make Linux different from other well-known operating systems. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054647"></A>However, Linux is even more different than you might imagine. In contrast to other operating systems, nobody owns Linux. Much of its development is done by unpaid volunteers.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1062098"></A>Development of what later became Linux began in 1984, when the <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gnu</EM>
 Free Software Foundation (www.gnu.org) began development of a free <EM CLASS="Small-Caps">
unix</EM>
-like operating system. Linux's name is derived from that of Linus Torvalds, who began development of a <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
unix</EM>
-like kernel in 1991. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1071318"></A>While many groups and individuals have contributed to Linux, the largest single contributor is still the Free Software Foundation, which created not only most of the tools used in Linux, but also the philosophy and the community that made Linux possible.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1069987"></A>Linux is released under the <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gnu</EM>
 General Public License (<EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gpl</EM>
). Unlike most software licenses, the <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gpl</EM>
 encourages users to freely copy, change, and distribute source code. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1071317"></A>For the Free Software Foundation, the emphasis of the <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gpl</EM>
 is on free software as a philosophical right. The group that focuses on applying the ideals in the <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gpl</EM>
 to business solutions is called the Open Source movement. Its emphasis is on the faster development and higher quality of software released under a public licence. However, to outsiders, these differences are mainly a matter of emphasis.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054697"></A>Although the <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gpl</EM>
 is often said to encourage fragmentation, Linux remains more or less standardized for several reasons.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054704"></A>First, final approval of changes to the kernel are overseen by Linus Torvalds and his closest associates, especially Allan Cox.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054705"></A>Second, Linux is released in different versions or distributions. Some distributions, like Debian, are volunteer efforts. Others, like Progeny, are commercial. However, all programs are kept as compatible as possible within the same distribution. Many programs also work with other distributions, or can be made to work with a little effort.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054712"></A>Third, volunteer software projects are usually coordinated by informal project managers known as maintainers. Although anyone can write improvements to a piece of software, the maintainer makes the final decision about which improvements become an official part of the project. Usually, the maintainer makes these decisions after consulting the leading contributors to the project.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054715"></A>These mechanisms are loose enough that Linux users still have immense freedom of choice in their software. For example, Linux users can choose from a dozen different command line shells and several graphical desktops. This selection is often bewildering to users of other operating systems, who are not used to thinking of the command line or desktop as something that they can change.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054643"></A>In addition to software selection, Linux is less likely to crash, better able to run more than one program at the same time, and more secure than many operating systems. With these advantages, Linux is the fastest growing operating system in the server market. More recently, Linux has begun to be popular among home and business users as well.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054585"></A>Development at Progeny Linux Systems builds on Debian <EM CLASS="Small-Caps">
gnu</EM>
/Linux (www.debian.org). Debian is a popular version of Linux. It is developed by a decentralized team of over <EM CLASS="Small-Caps">
600</EM>
 volunteer programmers in all parts of the world, and includes over 6000 software packages.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054592"></A>Debian was founded in <EM CLASS="Small-Caps">
1993</EM>
 by Ian Murdock, now president and <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
ceo</EM>
 of Progeny. The name of Debian combines Ian's name with that of his wife Debra. Its full name, Debian <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
gnu</EM>
/Linux, recognizes the central role of the GNU Free Software Foundation in developing Linux.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054593"></A>Debian has been a major force in the rise of Linux and Open Source software over the last seven years. In fact, the Debian Free Software guidelines became the main source of the Open Source Definition in 1998. Although Debian has been almost entirely non-commercial, it is one of the most popular distributions of Linux. It is also the basis for several commercial distributions, including Progeny Debian.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054596"></A>Debian is especially popular among advanced users because of its technical excellence and its deep commitment to the needs and expectations of the Linux community. Debian also introduced many features to Linux that are now commonplace. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054601"></A>For example, Debian was the first Linux distribution to include a package management system for easy installation and removal of software. It was also the first Linux distribution that could be upgraded without requiring reinstallation.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054597"></A>Debian continues to be a leader in Linux development. Its <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
apt</EM>
 program is second to none for managing software over the Internet. Moreover, its development process is an example of just how well the Open Source development model can work - even for very complex tasks such as building and maintaining a complete operating system.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054600"></A>Progeny Debian is not a distribution spun off from Debian in the sense that Mandrake is based on Red Hat. Progeny's efforts are contributions to Debian, not a replacement for it. In fact, many Progeny employees are (or have been) actively involved with Debian.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054617"></A>One of Progeny Debian's main goals is to bring ease of use and system integration enhancements to Debian without taking away the flexibility and power of the underlying Debian system. The areas that Progeny is working in include installation, system administration, hardware detection, and software management.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054626"></A>Another goal is to apply an additional testing and release cycle to the general Debian development cycle. Progeny hopes that this effort will help Debian provide its users with more frequent current and stable releases.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054604"></A>So far as possible, Progeny works with existing free software, and with existing Debian development efforts. As with Debian, all of Progeny Debian's development occurs in an open forum. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054633"></A>To get involved in Progeny's Debian development efforts, subscribe to the progeny-debian mailing list. Send an e-mail to progeny-debian-request@lists.progeny.com with the word <EM CLASS="Emphasis">

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054828"></A>To help you concentrate on learning, this manual uses as few conventions as possible. In fact, it has only three:</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054836"></A>&#183;	When you have to choose an icon or menu item with the mouse, you may be told to &quot;select&quot; or to &quot;click&quot; or &quot;click on.&quot; All these instructions mean that you should select an item with the cursor while depressing the left mouse button.</LI>
<P CLASS="Indented">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054837"></A>Similarly, &quot;right click&quot; means to use the right mouse button, while, &quot;middle click&quot; means to use the middle mouse button or the equivalent. </P>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060278"></A>&#183;	Information to type appears in a sans serif text, like this: <A NAME="marker-1070968"></A><EM CLASS="Emphasis">
chmod 777 todo.txt</EM>
. Punctuation after this text should not be typed.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060266"></A>&#183;	Small capitals in sans serif text indicate variable information. For example, the standard format for a command is:</LI>
<P CLASS="Indented">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060267"></A><EM CLASS="Variables">
command options argument files</EM>
</P>
<P CLASS="Indented">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060264"></A>The small capitals indicate that any command can replace the word &quot;command,&quot; any options the word &quot;options,&quot; and so on. </P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="Note">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060271"></A><DIV>
<IMG SRC="img/Intro-1.png">
</DIV>
Whenever files are a variable, you can also use a directory name.</P>
<P CLASS="Note">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060283"></A><DIV>
<IMG SRC="img/Intro-1.png">
</DIV>
Variable information may include <EM CLASS="Variables">
source</EM>
 and <EM CLASS="Variables">
target.</EM>
 The source is the file that original information is taken from. The target is the file that is acted upon. </P>
<P CLASS="Note-and-Warning-2nd-para">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060284"></A>For example, when a file is copied, the source is the file being copied, and the target is the new copy that is created.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1054960"></A><A NAME="marker-1070916"></A>Familiarizing Yourself with Linux</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054961"></A>This manual introduces concepts as you are likely to need them. For now, here are some concepts that may be new to you:</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054962"></A>&#183;	Linux generally uses a three-button mouse. If you do not have a middle mouse button, you can emulate three buttons by clicking the left and the right mouse buttons at the same time. </LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054965"></A>&#183;	The command line is much more flexible than you might think. It includes the abilities to cut and paste, to re-use previous commands, and to complete what you have typed in with a command.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054968"></A>&#183;	For greater security, Linux makes strict use of accounts. Unlike some operating systems, you cannot bypass logging in to the system by pressing the Enter key. Most users have only limited access to files. Typically, only the root user (also called the super user or system administrator) has access to all files.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1055957"></A>&#183;	Linux has a consistent system for naming hardware, but the system is different from that of other popular operating systems. You should know the Linux naming system to avoid accidentally over-writing information. </LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054970"></A>&#183;	Linux's directory system is similar to <EM CLASS="Heading-Small-Caps">
unix</EM>
's. Knowing the structure can help you find files.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054971"></A>&#183;	Progeny Debian includes the <EM CLASS="Small-Caps">
grub</EM>
 boot manager. With a boot manager, you can use more than one operating system on the same computer.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054987"></A>&#183;	Many Linux system settings can be changed by editing a configuration file in a text editor. </LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1060319"></A>&#183;	Linux provides services such as printing through a number of independent programs or processes. </LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1071330"></A>&#183;	Processes that start with your machine and run in the background until you need them are called daemons.</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1054990"></A>At first, these differences may seem overwhelming. Take your time and learn them as the need arises. Once you have learned them, you will find that the features of Linux give you more convenience, efficiency, and hands-on control than other popular operating systems. </P>
