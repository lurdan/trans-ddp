<!-- Sven deals with the version number and the date in the Makefile; 
     I think the Makefile is a better way to do it for the version 
     number, but built-in support for the date is better in the
     sgml file.

<abstract>
This text tells users of a Debian system how to build a kernel customized
to their needs and/or hardware.  It exploits a tool available on Debian
systems called <tt>make-kpkg</tt>, as well as the Debian package
installer, <tt>dpkg</tt>.  Instructions are also provided for 
building a Debian kernel on an alien system.
