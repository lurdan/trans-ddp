"15 Description: fully GUI-configurable, two-pane X file manager\n"
"16  gentoo is a two-pane file manager for the X Window System. gentoo lets "
"the\n"
"17  user do (almost) all of the configuration and customizing from within "
"the\n"
"18  program itself. If you still prefer to hand-edit configuration files,\n"
"19  they're fairly easy to work with since they are written in an XML "
"format.\n"
"20  .\n"
"21  gentoo features a fairly complex and powerful file identification "
"system,\n"
"22  coupled to a object-oriented style system, which together give you a "
"lot\n"
"23  of control over how files of different types are displayed and acted "
"upon.\n"
"24  Additionally, over a hundred pixmap images are available for use in "
"file\n"
"25  type descriptions.\n"
"26  .\n"
"29  gentoo was written from scratch in ANSI C, and it utilises the GTK+ "
"toolkit\n"
"30  for its interface."
