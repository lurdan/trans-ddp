<!--  ( This is taken from debian-reference)

When editing this file, use 8 bit clean and dumb editor such as mcedit.

Do not use smart editor such as emacs and vim.

These variables are read and used by all ???.??.sgml; they are included
separate from the main document since they may need to change.  This
allows builders to override the defaults without editing the main SGML
file.

Remember, this is SGML; the *first* definition of an entity wins.
