  <chapt id="start">Getting started The Right Way

  <p>This document tries to describe building of a Debian package to the
  common Debian user, and wannabe developer. It uses pretty common language,
  and it's well covered with working examples.
  There is an old Roman saying, <em>Longum
  iter est per preaecepta, breve et efficax per exempla!</em> (It's a long way
  by the rules, but short and efficient with examples!).

  <p>One of the things that makes Debian such a top-notch Linux distribution
  is its package system. While there is a vast quantity of software already
  in the Debian format, sometimes you need to install software that isn't.
  You may be wondering how you can make your own packages and perhaps you
  think it is a very difficult task. Well, if you are a real novice on Linux,
  it is hard, but if you were rookie, you wouldn't be reading this doc now. :-)
  You do need to know a little about Unix programming but you certainly
  don't need to be a wizard.

  <p>One thing is certain, though: to properly create and maintain Debian
  packages you need man hours. Make no mistake, for our system to work the
  maintainers need to be both technically competent and dilligent.

  <p>This document will explain every little (at first maybe irrelevant)
  step, and help you create that first package, and to gain some experience
  in building next releases of that and maybe other packages later on.

  <p>Newer versions of this document should always be available online at
  <url name="http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/" id="http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/">
  and in the `<package/maint-guide/' package.
  <!-- Translation in <this language> is also available in the
       `<package/maint-guide-xy/' package. -->

  <sect id="needprogs">Programs you need for development

  <p>Before you start anything, you should make sure that you have properly
  installed some additional packages needed for development. Note that the
  list doesn't contain any packages marked `essential' or `required' - we
  expect that you have those installed already.

  <p>This revision of this document has been updated for the packages in
  Debian 2.2 (`potato') and 3.0 (`woody').

  <p>The following packages come with the standard Debian installation,
  so you probably have them already (along with any additional packages
  they depend on).
  Still, you should check with `dpkg -s &lt;package&gt;`.

  <list>
  <item><package/dpkg-dev/ - this package contains the tools needed to unpack,
  build and upload Debian source packages. (see
  <manref name="dpkg-source" section="1">)

  <item><package/file/ - this handy program can determine what type a file is.
  (see <manref name="file" section="1">)

  <item><package/gcc/ - the GNU C compiler, necessary if your program like
  most others is written in the C programming language.
  (see <manref name="gcc" section="1">)
  This package will also "pull in" several other packages such as
  <package/binutils/ which includes programs used to assemble and link
  object files (see `info binutils` in the <package/binutils-doc/ package)
  and <package/cpp/, the C preprocessor. (see <manref name="cpp" section="1">)

  <item><package/g++/ - the GNU C++ compiler, necessary if your program
  is written in C++. (see <manref name="g++" section="1">)

  <item><package/libc6-dev/ - the C libraries and header files gcc needs to
  link with to create object files. (see `info libc` in the
  <package/glibc-doc/ package)

  <item><package/make/ - usually creation of a program takes several steps,
  so rather than having to type out the same commands over and over again,
  you can use this program to automate the process, creating `Makefile's.
  (see `info make`)

  <item><package/patch/ - this very useful utility will take file containing
  a difference listing (produced by the diff program) and apply it to the
  original file, producing a patched version. (see <manref name="patch" section="1">)

  <item><package/perl/ - Perl is one of the most used interpreted scripting
  languages on today's Unix-like systems, often referred to as "Unix's Swiss Army
  Chainsaw". (see <manref name="perl" section="1">)
  </list>

  <p>You'll probably want to install the following packages, too:

  <list>
  <item><package/autoconf/ and <package/automake/ - many newer programs use
  configure scripts and Makefiles preprocessed with help of programs like
  these. (see `info autoconf`, `info automake`)

  <item><package/dh-make/ and <package/debhelper/ - dh-make is necessary to
  create the skeleton of our example package, and it will use some the
  debhelper tools for creating packages. They are not essential for creation
  of packages, but it is <strong>highly</strong> recommended for new
  maintainers. It makes the whole process very much easier to start, and
  control afterwards. (see <manref name="dh_make" section="1">,
  <manref name="debhelper" section="1">, /usr/share/doc/debhelper/README)

  <item><package/devscripts/ - this package contain some nice and useful
  scripts that can be helpful to the maintainers, but they are also not
  necessary for building packages. (see /usr/share/doc/devscripts/README.gz)

  <item><package/fakeroot/ - this utility lets you emulate being root which
  is necessary for some parts of the build process. (see
  <manref name="fakeroot" section="1">)

  <item><package/gnupg/ - a tool that enables you to digitally <em>sign</em>
  packages. This is especially important if you want to distribute it to
  other people, and you will certainly be doing that when your work gets
  included in the Debian distribution. (see <manref name="gpg" section="1">)

  <item><package/g77/ - the GNU Fortran 77 compiler, necessary if your
  program is written in Fortran. (see <manref name="g77" section="1">)

  <item><package/gpc/ - the GNU Pascal compiler, necessary if your
  program is written in Pascal. Worthy of note here is <package/fp-compiler/,
  the Free Pascal Compiler, which is also good at this task.
  (see <manref name="gpc" section="1">, <manref name="ppc386" section="1">)

  <item><package/imake/ and <package/xmkmf/ - some programs, usually those
  made for X11, also use these programs to generate Makefiles from sets of
  macro functions. (see <manref name="imake" section="1">,
  <manref name="xmkmf" section="1">)

  <item><package/lintian/ - this is the Debian package checker that can let
  you know of any common mistakes after you build the package, and explain
  the errors found. (see <manref name="lintian" section="1">,
  /usr/share/doc/lintian/lintian.html/index.html)
  </list>

  <p>The following is the <em>very important</em> documentation which you
  should read along with this document:

  <list>
  <item><package/debian-policy/ - the Policy includes explanations of the
  structure and contents of the Debian archive, several OS design issues,
  the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (which says where each file and
  directory should be) etc.
  For you, the most important thing is that it describes requirements that
  each package must satisfy to be included in the distribution.
  (see /usr/share/doc/debian-policy/policy.html/index.html)

  <item><package/developers-reference/ - for all matters not specifically
  about the technical details of packaging, like the structure of the
  archive, how to rename, orphan, pick up packages, how to do NMUs, how to
  manage bugs, when and where to upload etc.
  (see /usr/share/doc/developers-reference/developers-reference.html/index.html)
  </list>

  <p>The short descriptions that are given above only serve to introduce
  you to what each package does. Before continuing please thoroughly read
  the documentation of each program, at least the standard usage.
  It may seem like heavy going now, but later on you'll be <em>very</em>
  glad you read it.

  <p>Note: <package/debmake/ is a package that contains some programs that
  function similar to dh-make, but its specific use is <strong>not</strong>
  covered in this document, because it is <em>deprecated</em>. Please refer
  to <url name="the Debmake manual" id="http://www.debian.org/~jaldhar/">
  for more information.

  <sect id="otherinfo">Other information

  <p>There are two types of packages you can make, source and binary.
  A source package contains code which you can compile into a program.
  A binary package contains just the finished program. Don't mix terms
  like source of the program and the source package of the program!
  Please read the other manuals if you need more details on terminology.

  <p>In Debian, the term `maintainer' is used for the person who makes
  packages, `upstream author' for the person that made the program, and
  `upstream maintainer' for the person who currently maintains that program,
  outside of Debian. Usually author and the upstream maintainer are the
  same person - and sometimes even the maintainer is the same person.
  If you made a program, and want it to get in Debian, feel free to submit
  your application to become a maintainer.

  <p>After you build your package (or while doing that), you will have
  to become an official Debian maintainer if you wish your program to get
  into the next distribution (if the program is useful, why not?).
  That process is explained in Developer's Reference. Please read it.

  <chapt id="first">First steps

  <sect id="choose">Choose your program

  <p>You have probably chosen the package you want to build, but here are
  some pointers for you as the uninitiated:

  <list>
  <item>check if the package is in the distribution already. If you use the
  `stable' distribution, maybe it's best that you go to the
  <url name="package search page" id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages">.
  If you use <strong>current</strong> `unstable' distribution, check it out
  with these commands:
  <example>
  dpkg -s program
  dpkg -l '*program*'
  </example>

  <item>consult the <url name="WNPP page" id="http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/">
  to see if anyone else is building
  that same package. If so, contact the current maintainer if you feel you
  need to. If not - find another interesting program that nobody maintains.
  </item>

  <item>program <strong>must</strong> have a license, if possible free as
  according to the <url name="Debian Free Software Guidelines" id="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">.
  If it doesn't conform to some of these rules but it can be distributed
  anyway, it could still can be included in the `contrib' or `non-free'
  sections. If you are unsure about where should it go, post the license
  text on <email/debian-legal@lists.debian.org/ and ask for advice.
  </item>

  <item>program certainly should <strong>not</strong> run setuid root, or
  even better - it shouldn't need to be setuid or setgid to anything.</item>

  <item>program should not be a daemon, or something that goes in */sbin
  directories, or open a port as root.</item>

  <item>program should result in binary executable form, libraries are
  harder to handle.</item>

  <item>it should be well documented, or and the code needs to be
  understandable (i.e. not obfuscated).</item>

  <item>you should contact program's author(s) to check if they agree
  with packaging it. It is important to be able to consult with author(s)
  about the program in case of any program specific problems, so don't
  try to package unmaintained pieces of software.</item>

  <item>and last but not the least, you must know that it works, and
  have it tried for some time.</item>
  </list>

  <p>Of course, these things are just safety measures, and intended to save
  you from raging users if you do something wrong in some setuid daemon...
  When you gain some more experience in packaging, you'll be able to do such
  packages, but even the experienced developers consult the debian-mentors
  mailing list when they are in doubt. And people there will gladly help.

  <p>For more help about these, check in Developer's Reference.

  <sect id="getit">Get the program, and try it out

  <p>So the first thing to do is to find and download the original package.
  I presume that you already have the source file that you picked up at
  the author's homepage. Sources for free Unix programs usually come in
  tar/gzip format, with extension .tar.gz, and usually contain the
  subdirectory called program-version and all the sources in it. If your
  program's source comes as some other sort of archive (for instance, the
  filename ends in ".Z" or ".zip"), unpack it with appropriate
  tools, or ask on the debian-mentors mailing list if you're not sure how to unpack it
  correctly (hint: issue `file archive.extension`).

  <p>As an example, I'll use program called `gentoo', an X GTK+ file
  manager. Note that the program is already packaged, and has changed
  substantially from the version while this text was first written.

  <p>Create a subdirectory under your home directory named 'debian' or 'deb'
  or anything you find appropriate (e.g. just ~/gentoo/ would do fine in
  this case). Place the downloaded archive in it, and uncompress it (with
  `tar xzf gentoo-0.9.12.tar.gz`). Make sure there are no errors, even some
  "irrelevant" ones, because there will most probably be problems unpacking
  on other people's systems, whose unpacking tools may or may not ignore
  those anomalies.

  <p>Now you have another subdirectory, called 'gentoo-0.9.12'. Change to
  that directory and <strong>thoroughly</strong> read the provided
  documentation. Usually there exist files named README*, INSTALL*, *.lsm
  or *.html. You must find instructions on how to correctly compile and
  install the program (most probably they'll assume you want to install to
  /usr/local/bin directory; you won't be doing that, but more on that later
  in <ref id="destdir">).

  <p>The process varies from program to program, but a lot of modern
  programs come with a `configure' script that configures the source under
  your system and makes sure that your system is in condition to compile it.
  After configuring with `./configure`, programs are usually compiled
  with `make`. Some of them support `make check`, to run included
  self-checks. Installation in destination directories is usually done with
  `make install`.
  
  <p>Now try to compile and run your program, to make sure it works properly
  and doesn't break something else while it's installing or running.

  <p>Also, you can usually run `make clean` (or better `make distclean`) to
  clean up the build directory. Sometimes there's even a `make uninstall`
  which can be used to remove all the installed files.

  <sect id="namever">Package name and version

  <p>You should start packaging with a completely clean (pristine) source
  directory, or simply with freshly unpacked sources.
  
  <p>For the package to be built correctly, you must make the program's
  original name lowercase (if it isn't already), and you should move the
  source directory to &lt;packagename&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.
  
  <p>If the program name consists of more than one word, contract them to one
  word, or make an abbreviation. For example, program "John's little editor
  for X" package would be named johnledx, or jle4x, or whatever you decide,
  as long as it's under some reasonable limit, e.g. 20 characters.

  <p>Also check for the exact version of the program (to be included in the
  package version). If that piece of software is not numbered with versions
  like X.Y.Z, but with some kind of date, feel free to use that date as the
  version number, prepended with a "0.0." (just in case upstream people one
  day decide to release a nice version like 1.0). So, if the release or
  snapshot date was 19th of December, 1998, you can use the version string
  of 0.0.19981219.

  <p>Some programs won't be numbered at all, in which case you
  should contact the upstream maintainer to see if they've got some other
  revision-tracking method.

  <sect id="dh_make">Initial "debianization"

  <p>Make sure you're in the program source directory, and issue this:

  <p><example>
  dh_make -e your.maintainer@address -f ../gentoo-0.9.12.tar.gz
  </example>

  <p>Of course, replace the string "your.maintainer@address" with your
  e-mail address for inclusion in the changelog entry and other files,
  and the filename with the name of your original source archive. See
  <manref name="dh_make" section="1"> for details.
 
  <p>Some information will come up. It will ask you what sort of package you
  want to create. Gentoo is a single binary package - it creates only one
  binary, and thus one .deb file - so we will select the first option, with
  the `s' key, check the information on the screen and confirm with pressing
  &lt;enter&gt;.

  <p>Once again, as a new maintainer you are discouraged from creating
  packages with multiple binary packages, or libraries. It's not too hard,
  but it does require a bit more knowledge,
  so we won't describe all of it here.

  <p>Please note that you should run dh_make <strong>only once</strong>,
  and that it won't behave correctly if you run it again in the same,
  already "debianized", directory. That also means that you will use a
  different method to release a new revision or a new version of your
  package in the future. Read more about that later in <ref id="update">

  <chapt id="modify">Modifying the source

  <p>Normally, programs install themselves in the /usr/local subdirectories. 
  But, Debian packages must not use that directory, since it is reserved for
  system administrator's (or user's) private use. This means that you have
  to take a look at your program's build system, usually starting with the
  Makefile. This is the script <manref name="make" section="1"> will use to
  automate building this program. For more details on Makefiles, look in
  <ref id="rules">.

  <p>Note that if your program uses GNU <manref name="automake" section="1">
  and/or <manref name="autoconf" section="1">, meaning the source includes
  Makefile.am and/or Makefile.in files, respectively, you will need to
  modify those files. This is because each automake invocation will rewrite
  Makefile.in's with information generated from Makefile.am's, and each
  ./configure invocation will do the same with Makefile's, with data from
  Makefile.in's. Editing Makefile.am files requires some knowledge of
  automake, which you can read about in the automake info entry, whereas editing
  Makefile.in files is pretty much the same as editing Makefile files, just
  pay attention on the variables, i.e. any strings surrounded with `@'s, for
  example @CFLAGS@ or @LN_S@, which are replaced with actual stuff on each
  ./configure invocation.

  <p>Also note that there isn't space here to go into <em>all</em> the
  details of fixing upstream sources, but here are a few problems people
  often run across.

  <sect id="destdir">Installation in a subdirectory

  <p>Most of the programs have some way of installing themselves in the
  existing directory structure of your system, so that their binaries get
  included in your $PATH, and that you find their documentation and manual
  pages in common places. However, if you do that, the program will be
  installed among everything else already on your system. This would make
  it hard for the packaging tools to figure out which files belong to your
  package and which don't.

  <p>Therefore you need to do something else: install the program into a
  temporary subdirectory from which the maintainer tools will build a working
  .deb package. Everything that is contained in this directory will be
  installed on user's system when they install your package, the only
  difference is that dpkg will be installing the files in the root
  directory.

  <p>This temporary directory is usually created under your debian/
  directory in the unpacked source tree. It is usually called
  <file>debian/tmp</file> or <file>debian/packagename</file>.

  <p>Bear in mind that even though you need to make the program install in
  debian/tmp, it still needs to behave correctly when placed in the root
  directory, i.e. when installed from the .deb package. So you mustn't
  allow the build system to hardcode strings like
  <tt>/home/me/deb/gentoo-0.9.12/usr/share/gentoo</tt> into the package
  files.

  <p>With programs that use GNU autoconf, this will be quite easy. Most such
  programs have makefiles that are by default set up to allow installation
  into a random subdirectory while keeping in mind that /usr (for example)
  is the canonical prefix. When it detects your program uses autoconf,
  dh_make will set up commands for doing all this
  automatically, so you might as well skip reading this section. But with
  other programs, you will most probably have to examine and edit the
  Makefiles.

  <p>Here's the relevant part of gentoo's Makefile:

  <p><example>
  # Where to put binary on 'make install'?
  BIN     = /usr/local/bin

  # Where to put icons on 'make install'?
  ICONS   = /usr/local/share/gentoo
  </example>

  <p>We see that the files are set to install under <file>/usr/local</file>.
  Change those paths to:

  <p><example>
  # Where to put binary on 'make install'?
  BIN     = $(DESTDIR)/usr/bin

  # Where to put icons on 'make install'?
  ICONS   = $(DESTDIR)/usr/share/gentoo
  </example>

  <p>But why in that directory, and not some other? Because Debian packages
  never install files beneath <file>/usr/local</file> -- that tree is
  reserved for the system administrator's use. Such files on Debian
  systems go under <file>/usr</file> instead.

  <p>The more exact locations for binaries, icons, documentation etc are
  specified in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
  (see /usr/share/doc/debian-policy/fhs/). I recommend you browse it and read
  the sections that might concern your package.

  <p>So, we should install the binary in /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin,
  the manual page in /usr/share/man/man1 instead of /usr/local/man/man1 etc.
  Notice how there's no manual page mentioned in gentoo's makefile, but
  since the Debian Policy requires that every program has one, we'll make
  one later and install it in /usr/share/man/man1.

  <p>Some programs don't use makefile variables to define paths such as
  these. This means you might have to edit some real C sources in order to
  fix them to use the right locations.
  But where and what to search? You can find this out by issuing:

  <p><example>
  grep -rn usr/local/lib *.[ch]
  </example>

  <p>Grep will run recursively through the source tree and tell
  you the name of the file and the line in it, when it finds an occurrence.

  <p>Edit those files and in those lines replace /usr/local/* with usr/*
  -- and that's about it. Be careful that you don't mess up the rest of
  the code! :-)

  <p>After that you should find the install target (search for line that
  starts with `install:', that will usually work) and rename all references
  to directories other than ones defined at the top of the Makefile.
  Previously, gentoo's install target said:

  <p><example>
  install:        gentoo
                  install ./gentoo $(BIN)
                  install icons/* $(ICONS)
                  install gentoorc-example $(HOME)/.gentoorc
  </example>

  <p>After our change it says:
  <example>
  install:        gentoo-target
                  install -d $(BIN) $(ICONS) $(DESTDIR)/etc
                  install ./gentoo $(BIN)
                  install -m644 icons/* $(ICONS)
                  install -m644 gentoorc-example $(DESTDIR)/etc/gentoorc
  </example>

  <p>You've surely noticed that there's now a <tt>install -d</tt> command
  before the other commands in the rule. The original makefile didn't have
  it because usually the /usr/local/bin and other directories already exist
  on the system where one runs `make install`. However, since we will
  install into our own empty (or even nonexistent) directory, we will have
  to create each and every one of those directories.

  <p>We can also add in other things at the end of the rule, like the
  installation of additional documentation that the upstream authors
  sometimes omit:

  <p><example>
                  install -d $(DESTDIR)/usr/share/doc/gentoo/html
                  cp -a docs/* $(DESTDIR)/usr/share/doc/gentoo/html
  </example>

  <p>A careful reader will notice that I changed `gentoo' to `gentoo-target'
  in the `install:' line. That is called an unrelated bug fix :-)

  <p>Whenever you make changes that are not specifically related to Debian
  package, be sure to send them to the upstream maintainer so they can be
  included in the next program revision and be useful to everyone else.
  Also remember to make your fixes not specific to Debian or Linux (or even
  Unix!) prior to sending them -- make them portable. This will make your
  fixes much easier to apply.

  <p>Note that you don't have to send the debian/* files upstream.

  <sect id="difflibs">Differing libraries

  <p>There is one other common problem: libraries are often different from
  platform to platform. For example, Makefile can contain a reference to a
  library which doesn't exist on Debian systems. In that case, we
  need to change it to a library which does exist in Debian, and serves the
  same purpose.

  <p>So, if there is a line in your program's Makefile (or Makefile.in) that
  says something like this (and your program doesn't compile):

  <p><example>
  LIBS = -lcurses -lsomething -lsomethingelse
  </example>

  <p>Change it to this, and it will most probably work:
  <p><example>
  LIBS = -lncurses -lsomething -lsomethingelse
  </example>

  <p>(The author realizes that this is not the best example considering our
  libncurses package now ships with a libcurses.so symlink, but he couldn't
  think of a better one. Suggestions very welcome :-)

  <chapt id="dreq">Required stuff under debian/

  <p>There is a new subdirectory under the program's source directory,
  it's called `debian'. There are a number of files in this directory that
  we should edit in order to customize
  the behavior of the package. The most important of them are `control',
  `changelog', `copyright' and 'rules', which are required for all packages.

  <sect id="control">`control' file

  <p>This file contains various values which <prgn/dpkg/, <prgn/dselect/ and
  other package management tools will use to manage the package.

  <p>Here is the control file dh_make creates for us:

  <p><example>
  1  Source: gentoo
  2  Section: unknown
  3  Priority: optional
  4  Maintainer: Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt;

  10 Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
  11 Description: &lt;insert up to 60 chars description&gt;
  12  &lt;insert long description, indented with spaces&gt;
  </example>
  (I've added the line numbers.)

  <p>Lines 1-6 are the control information for the source package.

  <p>Line 1 is the name of the source package.

  <p>Line 2 is the section of the distribution the source package goes into. 

  <p>As you may have noticed, Debian is divided in sections: main (the free
  software), non-free (the not really free software) and contrib (free
  software that depends on non-free software). Under those, there are
  logical subsections that describe in short what packages are in.
  So we have `admin' for administrator-only programs, `base' for the
  basic tools, `devel' for programmer tools, `doc' for documentation,
  `libs' for libraries, `mail' for e-mail readers and daemons, `net' for
  network apps and daemons, `x11' for X11 programs that don't fit anywhere
  else, and many more.

  <p>Let's change it then to x11. (A "main/" prefix is implied so we can
  omit it.)

  <p>Line 3 describes how important it is that the user installs this package.
  See the Policy manual for guidance on what to set this field to. The
  "optional" priority will usually work for new packages.

  <p>Section and priority are used by frontends like <prgn/dselect/ when
  they sort packages and select defaults. Once you upload the package to
  Debian, the value of these two fields can be overridden by the archive
  maintainers, in which case you will be notified by email.
  
  <p>As this is a normal priority package and doesn't conflict with anything
  else, we'll leave it as "optional".

  <p>Line 4 is the name and email address of the maintainer. Make sure that
  this field includes a valid "To: " header for an email, because after you
  upload it, the bug tracking system will use it to deliver bug emails to
  you. Avoid using commas, ampersands and parenthesis.

  <p>Line 5 is the version of the Debian Policy standards this package
  follows, the versions of the Policy manual you read while making your
  package.

  <p>The 6th line includes the list of packages required to build your
  package. Some packages like gcc and make are implied, see the
  <package/build-essential/ package for details. If some non-standard
  compiler or other tool is needed to build your package, you should add
  it to the `Build-Depends' line. Multiple entries are separated with
  commas; read on for the explanation of binary dependencies to find out
  more about the syntax of this field.

  <p>You can also have Build-Depends-Indep, Build-Conflicts and other fields
  here. This data will be used by the Debian automatic package building
  software in order to create binary packages for other computer platforms.
  See the Policy manual for more information about the build-dependencies
  and the Developers' Reference for more information about these other
  platforms (architectures) and how to port software to them.

  <p>Here's a hack you can use to find out which packages your package needs
  to be built:
  <example>
  strace -f -o /tmp/log ./configure
  # or make instead of ./configure, if the package don't use autoconf
  for x in `dpkg -S $(grep open /tmp/log|perl -pe 's!.* open\(\"([^\"]*).*!$1!' |grep "^/"| sort | uniq| grep -v "^\(/tmp\|/dev\|/proc\)" ) 2>/dev/null|cut -f1 -d":"| sort | uniq`; do echo -n "$x (>=" `dpkg -s $x|grep ^Version|cut -f2 -d":"` "), "; done
  </example>

  <p>Gentoo also happens to require <package/xlibs-dev/,
  <package/libgtk1.2-dev/ and <package/libglib1.2-dev/ to build, so we'll
  add them here next to <package/debhelper/.

  <p>Line 7 is the name of the binary package. This is usually the same as
  the name of the source package, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that
  way.

  <p>Line 8 describes the CPU architecture the binary package can be compiled
  for. We'll leave this as "any" because <manref name="dpkg-gencontrol"
  section="1"> will fill in the appropriate value for any machine this
  package gets compiled on.

  <p>If your package is architecture independent
  (for example, a shell or Perl script, or a document), change this to
  "all", and read later in <ref id="rules"> about using the `binary-indep'
  rule instead of `binary-arch' for building the package.

  <p>Line 9 shows one of the most powerful features of the Debian packaging
  system. Packages can relate to each other in various ways. Apart from
  Depends:, other relationship fields are Recommends:, Suggests:,
  Pre-Depends:, Conflicts:, Provides:, and Replaces:.

  <p>The package management tools usually behave the same way when dealing
  with these relations; if not, it will be explained.
  (see <manref name="dpkg" section="8">, <manref name="dselect" section="8">,
  <manref name="apt" section="8">, <manref name="aptitude" section="1"> etc.)

  <p>This is what the dependencies mean:

  <p><list>
  <item>Depends:
  <p>The package will not be installed unless the packages it depends on
  are installed. Use this if your program absolutely will not run (or will
  cause severe breakage) unless a particular package is present.</item>

  <item>Recommends:
  <p>Frontends such as dselect or aptitude will prompt you to install the
  recommended packages along with your package; dselect will even insist. 
  dpkg and apt-get will ignore this field, though. Use this for packages
  that are not strictly necessary but are typically used with your
  program.</item>

  <item>Suggests:
  <p>When a user installs your program, all frontends will likely prompt
  them to install the suggested packages. dpkg and apt-get won't care. Use
  this for packages which will work nicely with your program but are not at
  all necessary.</item>

  <item>Pre-Depends:
  <p>This is stronger than Depends:. The package will not be installed
  unless the packages it pre-depends on are installed <em>and correctly
  configured</em>. Use this <strong>very</strong> sparingly and only after
  discussing it on the debian-devel mailing list. Read: don't use it at
  all. :-)</item>

  <item>Conflicts:
  <p>The package will not be installed until all the packages it conflicts
  with have been removed. Use this if your program absolutely will not run
  or will cause severe problems if a particular package is present.</item>

  <item>Provides:
  <p>For some types of packages where there are multiple alternatives
  virtual names have been defined. You can get the full list in the
  /usr/share/doc/debian-policy/virtual-package-names-list.txt.gz file.
  Use this if your program provides a function of an existing virtual
  package.</item>

  <item>Replaces:
  <p>Use this when your program replaces files from another package, or
  completely replaces another package (used in conjunction with Conflicts:).
  Files from the named packages will be overwritten with the files from your
  package.
  </item>
  </list>

  <p>All these fields have uniform syntax. They are a list of package names
  separated by commas. These package names may also be lists of alternative
  package names, separated by vertical bar symbols `<tt>|</tt>' (pipe symbols).

  <p>The fields may restrict their applicability to particular versions of
  each named package. These versions are listed in parentheses after each
  individual package name, and they should contain a relation from the list
  below followed by the version number. The relations allowed are:
  <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>=</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt> and
  <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> for strictly earlier, earlier or equal, exactly equal,
  later or equal and strictly later, respectively. For example,

  <p><example>
  Depends: foo (>= 1.2), libbar1 (= 1.3.4)
  Conflicts: baz
  Recommends: libbaz4 (>> 4.0.7)
  Suggests: quux
  Replaces: quux (<< 5), quux-foo (<= 7.6)
  </example>
  
  <p>The last feature you need to know about is ${shlibs:Depends}.
  After your package has been built and installed into the temporary
  directory, <manref name="dh_shlibdeps" section="1"> will scan it for
  binaries and libraries, determine their shared library dependencies and
  detect which packages they are in, such as libc6 or xlib6g. It'll pass
  on the list to <manref name="dh_gencontrol" section="1"> which will fill
  it in the right place, and you won't have to worry about this yourself.

  <p>Having said all that, we can leave line 9 exactly as it is now, and
  insert another line after it saying <tt>Suggests: file</tt>, 
  because gentoo can use some features provided by that program/package.

  <p>Line 11 is the short description. Most people screens are 80 columns
  wide so this shouldn't be longer than about 60 characters. I'll change
  it to "A fully GUI configurable X file manager using GTK+".

  <p>Line 12 is where the long description goes. This should be a paragraph
  which gives more details about the package. Column 1 of each line should
  be empty. There must be no blank lines, but you can put a single . (dot)
  in a column to simulate that. Also, there must be no more that one blank
  line after the long description.

  <p>Finally, here is the updated control file:

  <p><example>
  1  Source: gentoo
  2  Section: x11
  3  Priority: optional
  4  Maintainer: Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt;
  5  Build-Depends: debhelper (>> 3.0.0), xlibs-dev, libgtk1.2-dev, libglib1.2-dev
  6  Standards-Version: 3.5.2
  7
  8  Package: gentoo
  9  Architecture: any
  10 Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
  11 Suggests: file
  12 Description: A fully GUI configurable GTK+ file manager
  13  gentoo is a file manager for Linux written from scratch in pure C. It
  14  uses the GTK+ toolkit for all of its interface needs. gentoo provides
  15  100% GUI configurability; no need to edit config files by hand and re-
  16  start the program. gentoo supports identifying the type of various
  17  files (using extension, regular expressions, or the 'file' command),
  18  and can display files of different types with different colors and icons.
  19  .
  20  gentoo borrows some of its look and feel from the classic Amiga file
  21  manager "Directory OPUS" (written by Jonathan Potter).

  <sect id="copyright">`copyright' file

  <p>This file contains the information about package upstream resources,
  copyright and license information. Its format is not dictated by the
  Policy, but the contents is (section 6.5). Dh_make created a default
  one, this is what it looks like:

  <p><example>
  1  This package was debianized by Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt; on
  2  Wed, 11 Nov 1998 21:02:14 +0100.

  </example>
  (I've added the line numbers.)

  <p>The important things to add to this file are the place you got the
  package from and the actual copyright notice and license. You must
  include the complete license, unless it's one of the common free software
  licenses such as GNU GPL or LGPL, BSD or the Artistic license, when you
  can just refer to the appropriate file in /usr/share/common-licenses/
  directory that exists on every Debian system. Gentoo is licensed under
  the GNU General Public License, so we'll change the file to this:

  <p><example>
  1  This package was debianized by Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt; on

  <sect id="changelog">`changelog' file

  <p>This is a required file, which has a special format described in
  the Packaging Manual (section 3.2.3). This format is used by dpkg and
  other programs to obtain the version number, revision, distribution and
  urgency of your package.

  <p>For you, it is also important, since it is good to have documented
  all changes you have done. It will help people downloading your package
  to see whether there are there any unresolved issues with the package
  that they should know about instantly. It will be saved as
  `/usr/share/doc/gentoo/changelog.Debian.gz' in the binary package.

  <p>Dh_make creates a default one, this is what it looks like:

  <p><example>
  1  gentoo (0.9.12-1) unstable; urgency=low
  2
  3   * Initial Release.
  4
  5  -- Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt; Wed, 11 Nov 1998 21:02:14 +0100
  6
  7  Local variables:
  8  mode: debian-changelog
  9  End:
  </example>
  (I've added the line numbers.)

  <p>Line 1 is the package name, version, distribution, and urgency.
  The name must match the source package name, distribution should be
  either `unstable' or `experimental' (for now), and urgency shouldn't
  be changed to anything higher than `low'. :-)
  
  <p>Lines 3-5 are a log entry, where you document changes made in this
  package revision (not the upstream changes - there is special file for
  that purpose, created by upstream authors, installed as
  /usr/share/doc/gentoo/changelog.gz). New lines must be inserted just
  before the uppermost line that begins with asterisk (`*'). You can do
  it with <manref name="dch" section="1">, <manref name="emacs" section="1">
  (lines 7-9 contain mode information for the Emacs editor), or any other
  text editor. You will end up with something like this:

  <p><example>
  1  gentoo (0.9.12-1) unstable; urgency=low
  2
  3   * Initial Release.
  4   * This is my first Debian package.
  5   * Adjusted the Makefile to fix $DESTDIR problems.
  6
  7  -- Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt; Wed, 11 Nov 1998 21:02:14 +0100
  8
  9  Local variables:
  10  mode: debian-changelog
  11 End:
  </example>
  (I've added the line numbers.)

  <p>When you release a new revision, you must increment the version number.
  You can do that with just `dch -i` or explicitly with `dch -v
  &lt;version&gt;-&lt;revision&gt;` and then insert the comments using your
  preferred editor. Tip: how to easily get the date in required format?
  Use `822-date`, or `date -R`.

  <p>New version information is added at the top of the changelog file.
  This is what the changelog looks like afterwards:

  <p><example>
  1  gentoo (0.9.12-2) unstable; urgency=low
  2
  3   * Fixed a glitch in the menu file.
  4
  5  -- Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt; Wed, 11 Nov 1998 22:15:39 +0100
  6
  7  gentoo (0.9.12-1) unstable; urgency=low
  8
  9   * Initial Release.
  10  * This is my first Debian package.
  11  * Adjusted the Makefile to fix $DESTDIR problems.
  12
  13 -- Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt; Wed, 11 Nov 1998 21:02:14 +0100
  14
  15 Local variables:
  16 mode: debian-changelog
  17 End:
  </example>
  (I've added the line numbers.)

  <p>You can read more about new package versions/revisions later in
  <ref id="update">.

  <sect id="rules">`rules' file

  <p>Now we need to take a look at the exact rules which
  <manref name="dpkg-buildpackage" section="1"> will use to actually create
  the package. This file is actually another Makefile, since it is executed
  with `make -f`, but different than the one in the upstream source.

  <p>Every `rules' file, as any other Makefile, consists of several rules
  specifying how to handle the source. Each rule consists of targets,
  filenames or names of actions that should be carried out (e.g. `build:'
  or `install:'). Rules that you want to execute are invoked as command
  line arguments (for example, `./debian/rules build` or `make -f rules
  install`). After the target name, you can name the dependency, program
  or file that that rule depends on. After that, there can be any number
  of commands (indented with &lt;tab&gt;!), until an empty line is found.
  There begins another rule. Multiple empty lines, and lines beginning
  with `#' (hash) are treated as comments and ignored.

  <p>You are probably confused now, but it will all be clear upon examination
  of the `rules' file that dh_make gives us as a default. You should also
  read the `make' entry in info for more information.

  <p>The important part to know about the rules file created by dh_make, is
  that it is just a suggestion. It will work for simple packages but for
  more complicated ones, don't be afraid to add and subtract from it to fit
  your needs. Only thing that you must not change are the names of the
  rules, because all the tools use these names, as mandated by the Packaging
  Manual.

  </example>
  (I've added the line numbers.)

  <p>You are probably familiar with lines like line 1 from shell and Perl
  scripts. It tells the operating system that this file is to be processed
  with /usr/bin/make.

  <p>Lines 12 through 19 describe the `build' (and its child `build-stamp')
  rule, which runs the application's own Makefile to compile the program.

  <p>The `clean' rule, as specified in lines 21-29, cleans up any unneeded
  binary or auto-generated stuff, left over from building the package.
  This rule must be working at all times (even when the source tree <em/is/
  cleaned up!), so please use the forcing options (e.g. for rm, that is
  `-f'), or ignore return values (with a `-' in front of a command name).

  <p>The installation process, the `install' rule, starts with line 31.
  It basically runs the `install' rule from the program's own Makefile,
  but installs in `pwd`/debian/tmp directory - this is why we specified
  $(DESTDIR) as the root installation directory in gentoo's Makefile.

  <p>As the comments suggest, the `binary-indep' rule, on the line 41, is
  used to build architecture independent packages. As we don't have any,
  nothing will be done there. If your package is `Architecture: all' one,
  you need to include all the commands for building the package under this
  rule, and leave the next rule (`binary-arch') empty instead.

  <p>On to the next rule - `binary-arch', on lines 45 through 73, in which
  we run several small utilities from the debhelper package that do various
  operations on your package files to make the package Policy conforming.
  
  <p>The names start with dh_, and the rest is the description of what the
  particular utility really does. It is all quite self-explanatory, but
  here are some additional explanations:

  <list>
  <item><manref name="dh_testdir" section="1"> checks that you are in the
        right directory (i.e. the top-level source directory),
  <item><manref name="dh_testroot" section="1"> checks that you have root
        permissions which is needed for binary* targets, and clean,
  <item><manref name="dh_installmanpages" section="1"> copies all the
        manpages it can find in the source tree to package (beware, this is
        DWIM),
  <item><manref name="dh_strip" section="1"> strips debugging headers from
        executable files and libraries, to make them smaller,
  <item><manref name="dh_compress" section="1"> gzips man pages and
        documentation larger than 4 kB,
  <item><manref name="dh_installdeb" section="1"> copies package related
        files (e.g. the maintainer scripts) under debian/tmp/DEBIAN directory,
  <item><manref name="dh_shlibdeps" section="1"> calculates shared libraries
        dependencies of the libraries and executables,
  <item><manref name="dh_gencontrol" section="1"> adds stuff to, and
        installs, the control file,
  <item><manref name="dh_md5sums" section="1"> generates MD5 checksums for
        all the files in the package.
  </list>

  <p>For more complete information on what do all these dh_* scripts do, and
  what are their other options, please read respective manual pages. There
  are some other, possibly very useful, dh_* scripts, which were not
  mentioned here. If you need them, read the debhelper documentation.

  <p>The binary-arch section is the one where you really should comment
  out any lines that call features you don't need. For gentoo, I'll comment
  out lines about testversion, emacsen, pam, init, cron, manpages, info,
  undocumented, suidregister, makeshlibs, and perl, simply because gentoo
  doesn't need them. Also, on the line 60, I'll need to add ` FIXES',
  because that is the name of the upstream changelog file.

  <p>The last two lines (along with any other not explained ones) are just
  some more-or-less necessary things, regarding which you can read in the
  make manual, and the Packaging Manual. For now, they're not important to
  know about.

  <chapt id="dother">Other files under debian/

  <p>You will see that there exist several other files in the debian/
  subdirectory, most of them with the `.ex' suffix, meaning that they are
  examples. If you wish or need to use any of those features, examine them
  and the related documentation (hint: the Policy Manual), rename them to
  remove the `.ex' suffix, and modify them and the rules file if necessary. 
  Some of those files, those commonly used ones, are explained in the
  following sections.

  <sect id="readme">README.Debian

  <p>Any extra details or discrepancies between the original package and
  your debianized version should be documented here. Dh_make created
  a default one, this is what it looks like:

  <example>
  gentoo for Debian
  ----------------------

  &lt;possible notes regarding this package - if none, delete this file&gt;

  Josip Rodin &lt;jrodin@jagor.srce.hr&gt;, Wed, 11 Nov 1998 21:02:14 +0100
  </example>

  <p>Since we don't have anything to put there - it is allowed to delete
  the file.


  <sect id="conffiles">conffiles

  <p>One of the most annoying things about software is when you spend a
  great deal of time and effort customizing a program only to have an
  upgrade stomp all over your changes. Debian solves this problem by
  marking configuration files so that when you upgrade a package you will
  be prompted whether you want to keep your old configuration or not. You
  do this by entering the full path to each configuration file (they are
  usually in /etc,) one per line, in a file called conffiles.

  <p>Gentoo has one conffile, /etc/gentoorc, and we'll enter that in the
  `conffiles' file. It is not actually necessary to have that file, if
  your program has no configuration files.

  <sect id="dirs">dirs

  <p>This file specifies the directories which we need but the normal
  installation procedure (make install) somehow doesn't create.

  By default, it looks like this:
  <p><example>
  usr/bin
  usr/sbin
  </example>

  <p>Note that the preceding slash is not included. We would have normally
  changed it to look like this:
  <p><example>
  usr/X11R6/bin
  usr/X11R6/man/man1
  </example>
  
  but those directories are already created in the Makefile, so we won't
  need this file, and we may delete it.

  <sect id="manpage">manpage.1.ex

  <p>The files ending in *.ex are examples of how to add that kind of
  support into the package. To use one of them, edit it and remove
  the .ex extension. If you don't want to use it, just delete it.

  <p>Your program should have a man page. If it doesn't, this is a skeleton
  you can fill out. See the man pages for <manref name="man" section="7">
  for a brief description of how to create a man page. Be sure to rename
  this file to the name of the program and make the extension the manual
  section it should go into. Here's a short list:

  <p><example>
  Section |     Description     |     Notes
     1     User commands          Executable commands or scripts.
     2     System calls           Functions provided by the kernel.
     3     Library calls          Functions within system libraries.
     4     Special files          Usually found in /dev
     5     File formats           E.g. /etc/passwd's format
     6     Games                  Or other frivolous programs
     7     Macro packages         Such as man macros.
     8     System administration  Programs typically only run by root.
     9     Kernel routines        Non-standard calls and internals.
  </example>
  
  <p>So gentoo's manpage should be called gentoo.1, or gentoo.1x because it
  is an X11 program. There was no gentoo.1 man page in the original source
  so I wrote it using information from the example and from upstream docs.

  <sect id="menu">menu.ex

  <p>X Window System users usually have a window manager with a menu that
  can be customized to launch programs. If they have installed the Debian
  "menu" package, a set of menus for every program on the system will be
  created for them. It isn't required by the Debian Policy, but users will
  surely appreciate it. We can add Gentoo to the menus by editing this
  file. Here's the default that dh_make creates:
  
  <p><example>
  ?package(gentoo):needs=X11|text|vc|wm section=Apps/see-menu-manual\
    title="gentoo" command="/usr/bin/gentoo"
  </example>

  <p>The first field specifies what kind of interface the program needs
  (e.g. text or X11). The next is the menu and submenu the entry should
  appear in. The current list of sections is at:
  /usr/share/doc/debian-policy/menu-policy.html/ch2.html#s2.1
  The third field is the name of the program. The fourth is the icon for
  the program or none if there isn't one. The fifth is the actual text
  which will appear in the menu. Finally, the sixth field is the command
  that runs the program.

  <p>Now we'll change the menu entry to this:
  <p><example>
  ?package(gentoo):needs=X11 section=Apps/Misc \
    title="Gentoo" command="/usr/X11R6/bin/gentoo"
  </example>

  <p>See <manref name="menufile" section="5">, <manref name="update-menus" section="1">
  and /usr/share/doc/debian-policy/menu-policy.html/ for more information.

  <sect id="watch">watch.ex

  <p>You can use this file in addition to the <manref name="uscan" section="1">
  and <manref name="uupdate" section="1"> programs (in the devscripts package)
  to watch the site you got the original source from. Here's what I put in
  it:

  <p><example>
  # watch control file for uscan
  # Site		Directory	Pattern			Version	Script
  ftp.obsession.se	/gentoo		gentoo-(.*)\.tar\.gz	debian	uupdate
  </example>

  <p>Hint: connect to the Internet, and try running "uscan" in the program
  directory once you create the file. And read the manual pages.

  <sect id="doc-base">ex.doc-base

  <p>If your package has HTML or any other documentation (except manual
  pages and info docs), you should use the `doc-base' file to register it,
  so the user can find it with e.g. <manref name="dhelp" section="1"> or
  <manref name="dwww" section="1">.

  <p>This is how gentoo's doc-base file looks like:

  <p><example>
  Document: gentoo
  Title: Gentoo Manual
  Author: Emil Brink
  Abstract: This manual describes what Gentoo is, and how it can be used.
  Section: Apps/Tools

  Format: HTML
  Index: /usr/share/doc/gentoo/html/index.html
  Files: /usr/share/doc/gentoo/html/*.html
  </example>

  <p>For information on the file format, see <manref name="install-docs" section="8">
  and the doc-base manual, in /usr/doc/doc-base/doc-base.html/index.html.

  <sect id="maintscripts">postinst.ex, preinst.ex, postrm.ex, prerm.ex

  <p>These files are called maintainer scripts, scripts which are put in the
  control area of the package and run by dpkg when your package is installed,
  upgraded or removed.

  <p>For now, you should try to avoid any manual editing of maintainer
  scripts if you possibly can because they tend to get complex. For more
  information look in the Packaging Manual, section 6, and take a look at
  these example files provided by dh_make.

  <p>We should now be ready to build the package.

  <chapt id="final">Final steps

  <sect id="build">Building the package

  <p>Enter the program's main directory and then issue this command:

  <p><example>
  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
  </example>

  <p>This will do everything for you, you'll just have to enter your
  PGP secret key, twice. After it's done, you will see four new files
  in the directory above (~/debian/):

  <p><list>
  <item><em>gentoo_0.9.12-1_i386.deb</em>
  <p>This is the completed binary package. You can use dpkg or dselect to
  install and remove this just like any other package.

  <item><em>gentoo_0.9.12.orig.tar.gz</em>
  <p>This is the original source code gathered up so that if someone else
  wants to recreate your package from scratch they can. Or if they aren't
  using the Debian packaging system, but need to manually download the
  source and compile.

  <item><em>gentoo_0.9.12-1.dsc</em>
  <p>This is a summary of the contents of the source code. The file is
  generated from the gentoo-0.9.12/debian/control file, and is used when
  unpacking the source with <manref name="dpkg-source" section="1">. This
  file is PGP signed, so that people can be sure that it's really yours.

  <item><em>gentoo_0.9.12-1.diff.gz</em>
  <p>This compressed file contains each and every addition you made to the
  original source code, in the form known as "unified diff". It is made
  and used by <manref name="dpkg-source" section="1">.

  <item><em>gentoo_0.9.12-1_i386.changes</em>
  <p>This file describes all the changes made in the current package
  revision, and it is used by the Debian FTP archive maintenance programs
  to install the binary and source packages in it. It is partly generated
  from the gentoo-0.9.12/debian/changelog file and the .dsc file.

  <p>As you keep working on the package, behavior will change and new
  features will be added. People downloading your package can look at this
  file and quickly see what has changed. The long strings of numbers are MD5
  checksums for the files mentioned. Person downloading your files can test
  them with <manref name="md5sum" section="1"> and if the numbers don't
  match, they'll know the file is corrupt or has been hacked. This file is
  PGP signed, so that people can be even more sure that it's really yours. 
  </list>

  <p>With a large package, you may not want to rebuild from scratch every
  time while you tune a detail in debian/rules. For testing purposes, you
  can make a .deb file without rebuilding the upstream sources like this:

  <p><example>
  fakeroot debian/rules binary
  </example>

  <p>Just make sure that your `install' rule does <strong/not/ have
  `install-stamp' child (that's the default nowadays), to make sure
  `dh_clean -k` is run each time. And once you are finished with cleanups,
  remember to rebuild following the right procedure, to be able to
  upload correctly.

  <sect id="checkit">Checking the package for errors

  <p>Run <manref name="lintian" section="1"> on your .changes file; this
  program will check for many common packaging errors. The command is:
  
  <p><example>
  lintian -i gentoo_0.9.12-1_i386.changes
  </example>
  
  <p>Of course, replace the filename with the name of the changes file
  generated for your package. If it appears that there are some errors
  (lines beginning with E:), read the explanation (the N: lines), correct
  mistakes, and rebuild as described in <ref id="build">. If there are
  lines that begin with W:, those are only warnings, so you can be pretty
  much sure that your package is okay (but it most probably needs some tuning).

  <p>Note that you can build the package with dpkg-buildpackage and run
  lintian all in one command with <manref name="debuild" section="1">.

  <p>Look inside the package using a file manager like <manref name="mc" section="1">,
  or unpack it in a temporary place using <manref name="dpkg-deb" section="1">.
  Be on the lookout for extra unneeded files both in the binary and source
  package, in case something went wrong and some cruft didn't get cleaned
  up. Tips: `zgrep ^+++ ../gentoo_0.9.12-1.diff.gz` will give you a list of
  your changes/additions to the source files, and `dpkg-deb -c gentoo_0.9.12-1_i386.deb`
  will list the files in the package.

  <p>Install the package to test it yourself, e.g. using the
  <manref name="debi" section="1"> command as root. Try to install and run
  it on machines other than your own and watch closely for any warnings
  or errors both on installation and running the program.

  <p>Later, when you build a new version, you should do the following to
  ensure basic upgradability of the package:

  <list>
  <item>upgrade from the previous version (and from the version in last Debian release),
  <item>downgrade back again,
  <item>install the package as a new package (i.e., with no previous version installed),
  <item>uninstall it, reinstall it again, and then purge it.
  </list>

  <sect id="upload">Uploading the package

  <p>Now that you have tested your new package thoroughly, you'll need to
  upload these files to master.debian.org, using <manref name="dupload" section="1">.
  First you have to set up dupload's config file, ~/.dupload.conf . Put
  something like this in it:

  <p><example>
  package config;
  $default_host = "master";
  
  $cfg{"master"}{"method"} = "scpb";
  $cfg{"master"}{"login"} = "joy";
  $cfg{"master"}{"visibleuser"} = "jrodin";
  $cfg{"master"}{"visiblename"} = "jagor.srce.hr";
  $cfg{"master"}{"fullname"} = "Josip Rodin";
  
  $cfg{"non-us"}{"method"} = "scpb";
  $cfg{"non-us"}{"login"} = "joy";
  $cfg{"non-us"}{"visibleuser"} = "jrodin";
  $cfg{"non-us"}{"visiblename"} = "jagor.srce.hr";
  $cfg{"non-us"}{"fullname"} = "Josip Rodin";
  
  1;
  </example>

  <p>Of course, change my personal settings to yours, and read the
  <manref name="dupload.conf" section="5"> manual page to understand
  what each of these options means.

  <p>Then connect to your Internet provider, and issue this command:
  
  <p><example>
  dupload --to master gentoo_0.9.12-1_i386.changes
  </example>

  <p>Dupload checks that the files' md5 checksums match those from the
  .changes file, so it will warn you to rebuild it as described in
  <ref id="build"> so it can properly upload.

  <p>Dupload will ask for your password on master.debian.org, upload the
  packages, and give a short announcement about your upload on
  <email/debian-devel-changes@lists.debian.org/ if necessary.

  <p>If you live in Europe, you can use some other upload queues instead
  of master. For details look in <manref name="dupload" section="1">,
  <manref name="dupload.conf" section="5"> and the Developer's Reference.

  <chapt id="update">Updating the package

  <sect id="newrevision">New Debian revision

  <p>Let's say that a bug report was filed against your package, #54321,
  and it describes a problem that you can solve. To create a new Debian
  revision of the package, you need to:

  <list>
  <item>Correct the problem in the package source, of course.

  <item>Add a new revision in the Debian changelog file, with
  `dch -i`, and include a short description of the bug and the solution,
  followed by this: "Closes: #54321". That way, the bug report will be
  automagically closed by the archive maintenance software the moment your
  package gets accepted in the Debian archive.

  <item>Repeat what you did in <ref id="build">, <ref id="checkit">,
  and <ref id="upload">. The difference is that this time, original source
  archive won't be included, as it hasn't been changed and it already
  exists in the Debian archive.
  </list>

  <sect id="newupstream">New upstream release

  <p>Now let's consider a different, a wee bit more complicated situation
  - a new upstream version was released, and of course you want it packaged.
  You need to do the following:

  <list>
  <item>Download the new sources and put the tarball (e.g. named
  `gentoo-0.9.13.tar.gz') in the directory above the old source tree
  (e.g. ~/debian/).

  <item>Enter the old source directory, and run:

  <example>
  uupdate -u gentoo-0.9.13.tar.gz
  </example>

  Of course, replace this filename with the name of your program's source
  archive. <manref name="uupdate" section="1"> will properly rename that
  tarball, try to apply all the changes from your previous .diff.gz file,
  and update the new debian/changelog file.

  <item>Change directory to `../gentoo-0.9.13', the new package source tree,
  and repeat what you did in <ref id="build">, <ref id="checkit">, and
  <ref id="upload">.
  </list>

  <p>Note that if you set up `debian/watch' file as described in
  <ref id="watch">, you can run <manref name="uscan" section="1"> to
  automagically look for revised sources, download them, and run uupdate.

  <chapt id="helpme">Where to ask for help

  <p>Before you decide to ask your question in some public place, please
  just RTFM. That includes documentation in /usr/share/doc/dpkg,
  /usr/share/doc/debian, /usr/share/doc/package/* files and the man/info
  pages for all the programs mentioned in this article. When you receive
  a bug report (yes, actual bug reports!), you will know that it is time
  that you dig in the <url name="Debian Bug Tracking System" id="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">
  and read the documentation there, to be able to deal with the reports
  efficiently.

  <p>By joining the Debian Mentors' mailing list at <email/debian-mentors@lists.debian.org/
  you can team up with experienced Debian developers who will help you with
  questions you might have. You can subscribe to it by sending e-mail
  to <email/debian-mentors-request@lists.debian.org/ with the word
  `subscribe' in the message subject.

  <p>If you still have questions, ask on the Debian Developers' mailing list
  at <email/debian-devel@lists.debian.org/. You can subscribe to it by
  sending e-mail to <email/debian-devel-request@lists.debian.org/ with the
  word `subscribe' in the message subject. If you are already a Debian
  developer, you should be subscribed to it anyway.

  <p>Even if it all worked well, it's time to start praying. Why? Because
  in just a few hours (or days) users from all around the world will start
  to use your package, and if you made some critical error you'll get
  mailbombed by numerous angry Debian users... Just kidding. :-)

  <p>Relax and be ready for bug reports, because there is a lot more work
  to be done before it will be fully in line with Debian policies (once again,
  read the <em>real documentation</em> for details). Good luck!
