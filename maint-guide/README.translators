Dear translator,

Thanks for considering the translation of this document to your language.

Please, before working in a translation contact the official translation
team for your language (list available at http://lists.debian.org/i18n.html) to
ensure that nobody is currently working already on a translation of this
document.

Also, note that translation teams have rules and styles related to translation
(to maintain consistency across all translations being produced) you should try to adhere to these too.

If you are interested in updating an existing translation. Please contact
both the previous translator (you will find more information below) as well
as the language's translation team *first* before working on the translation.

This ensures that there are no duplicate efforts when working on translations
and wasted work.

If no translation team exists yet for your language you might consider setting
up an official list to coordinate translations.
