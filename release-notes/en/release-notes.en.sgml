        old, you might wish to download the latest version.]</p>

        <p>Previously &debian; 2.2 ('potato') supported six
        computer architectures. In this release those six are joined
        by four more indicated by a trailing asterisk [*] below. Here is the
        full list of architectures for this release:</p>

        <p>
          <list>

<!-- i386 doesn't have a port page - or do they now? -->

          <p>You can read more about port status, and port-specific
          information for your architecture at the <url id="&url-ports;"

<![ %hppa %s390 %mips %mipsel %ia64 [ 

          <p>This is the first official release of &debian; for the
          &arch-title; architecture. We feel that it has proven itself
          sufficiently to be released. However, because it has not had the
          exposure (and hence testing by users) that our other releases on
          other architectures have had, you may encounter a few bugs. Please
          use our <url id="&url-bts;" name="bug tracking system"> to report
          any problems; make sure to mention the fact that the bug is on the
          &architecture; platform.</p>

]]>

          <p>&debian; &release; for the &arch-title; architecture ships with
          kernel version &kernelversion;.</p>

<![ %default-kernel-2.2 [ 

          <p>The 2.2 kernel series has been updated and developed
          extensively introducing several valuable changes both in the
          kernel and in other programs based on kernel features, along with
          a whole slew of new hardware drivers and bug fixes for existing
          drivers.</p>
          
          <p>A 2.4 kernel is also included in this release for optional
          installation by users. Although the 2.4 branch is considered by the
          kernel developers to be a stable kernel branch, the &debian;
          release team judged it not to have reached sufficient maturity for
          inclusion as the default kernel in this release.</p>

]]>
        
        <sect id="newinst"><heading>What's New in the Installation System?</heading>

          <p>The new <package>debootstrap</package> tool downloads, unpacks
          and extracts &debian; packages for the base system installation. 
          This is an improvement over the previous installation system which
          used a tarball containing the base system. The installation base
          system can be updated more dynamically with this system.</p>

          <p>The task system has been revamped. Tasks in the previous
          release consisted of meta packages (packages which are simply
          collections of other packages). The new system uses special
          headers within the existing package system to designate any tasks
          to which each package may belong.</p>

<!-- this isn't true, is it? We don't have any way for people to pick
part of a task except to pick some packages, right? -->

          <p>This allows greater selection of tasks and it is much easier to
          only install selected components of tasks, instead of the whole
          thing.</p>
         
          
<!-- TODO: 
- Ask on debian-boot how many translated boot-floppies are
available.  
- get the number of packages with po files translated
(international/l10n only has the number of po files).  
- get the number of packages with debconf files translated (idem) -->

          <p>Almost all configuration at install time and for later
          reconfiguration is done using Debconf, which comes in a variety of
          flavours: a non-interactive method, dialog (curses-based), and a
          new GNOME frontend. Debconf's engine has also been revamped and
          improved and is now more flexible than ever. In short, Debconf
          makes the world go around :)</p>
        
          <p>For full details on the Debian installation system, users are
          advised to read the Debian installation guide included on the
          first CD or at <url id="&url-install-manual;"></p>

<![ %i386 [ 

          <p>Kernel images are available in various "flavors". These
          flavors each support a different set of hardware. The flavors
          available in &debian; &release; for &arch-title; are:</p>

          <p>
            <taglist>
              <tag>`vanilla'</tag>
              <item><p>The standard kernel package available in Debian. This
              includes almost all drivers supported by Linux built as
              modules. Including drivers for network devices, SCSI
              devices, sound cards, Video4Linux devices, etc. The
             `vanilla' flavor includes one rescue, one root and four
              driver disks.</p></item>

              <tag>`ide'</tag> 
              <item><p>Very similar to `vanilla', except it includes Andre
              Hedrick's IDE patches to support UDMA66 devices.</p></item>

              <tag>`compact'</tag>
              <item><p>Like `vanilla', but with many of the
              less-frequently-use drivers removed (sound, Video4Linux, etc).
              In addition, it has built-in support for several popular PCI
              ethernet devices: NE2000, 3COM 3c905, Tulip, Via-Rhine and
              Intel EtherExpress Pro100.  These built in drivers allow you
              to take full advantage of the Debian installer's net install
              feature to install the driver and/or base system over a
              network so that only the root and rescue disks need to be
              made. Finally, `compact' also supports several common RAID
              controllers: DAC960, and Compaq's SMART2 RAID controllers. 
              The `compact' flavor includes one rescue, one root and two
              driver disks.</p></item>

              <tag>`idepci'</tag> 
              <item><p>The `idepci' kernel supports only IDE and PCI devices
              (and a very small number of ISA devices). This kernel should
              be used if the SCSI drivers in the other flavors cause your
              system to hang on startup (probably because of resource
              conflicts, or a misbehaving driver/card in your system). The
             `idepci' flavor also has a built-in ide-floppy driver so
              that you can install from LS120 or ZIP devices.</p></item>

              <tag>`bf2.4`</tag>
              <item><p>This is an experimental flavor which uses a special
              version of the kernel-image-2.4 package.  It contains support
              for some new hardware which does not exist in the (more
              stable) other flavors. It supports more USB hardware, modern
              IDE controllers, newer network cards and Ext3 and Reiser
              filesystems.  Compared to the driver set of our main
              kernel-image-2.4.x-yz packages, some non-essential drivers
              have been removed in order to minimize the number of floppy
              disks needed.</p></item>

            </taglist>
          </p>

          <p>The kernel config files for these flavors can be found in their
          respective directories in a file named 'kernel-config'.</p>

]]></sect>

        <sect id="newdistro"><heading>What's New in the Distribution?</heading> 

<![ %default-kernel-2.2 %not-i386 [

           <p>At install time, the kernel used is &kernelversion;, however a
           2.4 kernel, the latest stable branch is included for those who
           wish to benefit from it.</p>

]]>

           <p>The Debian package management tools apt and dpkg have been
           improved considerably in this release. Now apt supports "pinning"
           in which the user can opt to download certain packages from
           different distributions, e.g. testing or unstable, while still
           keeping the bulk of packages in the stable distribution. APT will
           automagically download and install appropriate dependent packages
           from the advanced distribution as required. An
           <url id="&url-apt-pin-howto;"
           name='APT "pinning" howto'> is available.</p>
           
           <p>Build dependencies have been added to aid the compilation of
           source packages. The "build-dep" apt-get method can be used to
           retrieve all packages needed for a build before compilation is
           commenced.</p>
           
           <p>To replace the aging, much-maligned, yet still popular
           <package>dselect</package>, many apt frontends have been in
           development during the woody release cycle. Interested users
           should investigate the <package>aptitude</package> package.</p>
       
           <p>This release of &debian; contains the much improved XFree86
           4.1 release, which includes support for a greater range of
           hardware, better autodetection support, and improved support for
           advanced technologies such as Xinerama and 3D acceleration.
           XFree86 3.3.6 is available as an option, to support older
           hardware that is not supported by XFree86 4.1.</p>
          
           <p>Debian 3.0 is much more secure than previous releases. The
           base installation provides fewer unnecessary services that might
           be the target of attack. Debian 3.0 includes many more
           security-oriented applications such as firewall administration,
           server hardening, and intrusion detection. The packaging system
           has also been improved so it can be configured to automatically
           check digital signatures.  When configured, it will refuse to
           install Debian packages if the digital signature doesn't match. 
           This limits the possibility of trojan horse installation and
           makes it easier and safer for systems to automatically upgrade
           themselves over the Internet.  Lastly, Debian now provides
           intensive documentation for the security-aware administrator
           including the <url id="&url-securing-debian;" name="'Securing
           Debian Manual'"> from the Debian Documentation Project (also
           available in the <package/harden-doc/ package).</p>

           <p>Debian 3.0 is also much more <url
           id="&url-debian-i18n;"
           name="internationalized"> than previous releases thanks to the
           ongoing work of free software translation teams. Debian includes
           default settings for more languages than previous releases, and
           more of its programs are international-ready.  This includes the
           boot-floppies installation which has been translated to a number
           of languages. There is extensive support for French, German,
           Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan and Danish, and
           there are more than fifteen active translation teams. </p>
          
           <p>For the first time, &debian; includes several full
           featured free graphical web browsers in the form of Mozilla,
           Galeon and Konqueror. With the inclusion of KDE 2.2 for the first
           time, as well as the new GNOME 1.4 release, Debian's desktop
           provision has been radically improved.</p>

           <p>The official &debian; distribution now ships on seven
           binary CDs with a similar number of source CDs, and a DVD version
           of the distribution is now also available.</p></sect>

      </chapt>

      <chapt id="installing"><heading>New Installations</heading>

        <p>If you are making a new installation of Debian, you should read
        the installation manual, which is available on the Official CD at:

        <example>        
          /dists/&releasename;/main/disks-&architecture;/current/doc/install.txt
          (or .html)
        
        </example></p>

        <p>or on the Internet at: <url id="&url-install-manual;"></p>

        <p>The Debian installation system, which is called the
        <package/boot-floppies/ (even though it supports more than just
        floppies), has been further streamlined and upgraded for users'
        convenience.</p>

          horrific consequences. It should also be mentioned that the virus

          <p>Regulation nr. 84 (21.02.2002, Estonian Government), valid from
          01.03.2002, says, that starting from this year (spring, 2002),
          there is a daylight savings time in Estonia.  The beginning of
          daylight savings time ("summer time" in estonian) is on last
          Sunday of March 01:00 GMT (03:00 local time) and end on last
          Sunday of October 01:00 GMT (04:00 local time).  You should be
          able to use exactly the same rules as for Helsinki in
          <file>/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Helsinki</file> file.
        </sect1>

        <sect1 id="postgresql"> <heading>Upgrading PostgreSQL</heading>
 
          <p>The new version of PostgreSQL is more strict and restrictive in
          its input handling.  This means that tests line <prgn/foo = NULL/
          which is not valid anyway won't be accepted anymore.  This also
          means that when using UNICODE encoding, ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-15
          are no longer valid encodings to use when inserting data into the
          relation in question.  In such a case you are advised to convert
          the corresponding relation dump, which you can alway make using
          <prgn/pg_dump -t table database/, using <prgn/recode
          latin1..utf-16/.</p>

          <p>This particular change can also affect the upgrade process,
          since dumping and importing data from the old and into the new
          database may stomp over illegal input.</p>

          <p>The version of m4 in woody does not run on Linux kernels from
          the 2.0 series. It is therefore strongly recommended that users of
          sendmail upgrade to a 2.2 series or better Linux kernel before
          proceeding with the upgrade.
       
        </sect1>
        
        </sect>
        <sect id="backup"><heading>Preparing for the Upgrade</heading>

          <p>Before upgrading your system, it is strongly recommended that
          you make a full backup, or at least backup any data or
          configuration information you can't afford to lose. The upgrade
          tools and process are quite reliable, but a hardware failure in
          the middle of an upgrade could result in a severely damaged
          system.</p>

          <p>The main things you'll want to back up are the contents of
          <file>/etc</file>, <file>/var/lib/dpkg</file> and the output of
          <tt>dpkg --get-selections \*</tt>.</p>

          <p>It's wise to inform all users in advance of any upgrades you're
          planning, although users accessing your system via ssh (at least)
          shouldn't notice much during the upgrade, and may want to continue
          working. If you wish to take extra precautions, back up or unmount
          user's partitions (<file>/home</file>) before upgrading. A reboot
          will not normally be necessary.</p>

          <p>Distribution upgrade should be done either locally from a
          textmode virtual console (or a directly connected serial
          terminal), or remotely via an <prgn/ssh/ link.</p>

          <p><em/Important/: You should <em/not/ upgrade using
          <prgn/telnet/, <prgn/rlogin/, <prgn/rsh/, or from an X session
          managed by <prgn/xdm/ on the machine you are upgrading. That is
          because each of those services may well be terminated during the
          upgrade, which can result in an <em/inaccessible/ system that is
          only half-upgraded.</p>


        <sect1><heading>Checking Packages Status</heading>

          <p>Regardless of the method used for upgrading, it is recommended
          that you check the status of all packages first, and verify that
          all packages are in an upgradable state. The following command
          will show any packages which have a status of Half-Installed or
          Failed-Config, and those with any error status.

          <example>
        
            # dpkg --audit
          
          </example></p>
 
          <p>You could also inspect the state of all packages on your system
          using <prgn/dselect/, or with commands such as

          <example>
         
            # dpkg -l | pager 

          </example></p>

          <p>or

          <example>
         
            # dpkg --get-selections &gt; ~/curr-pkgs.txt

          </example></p>

          <p>It is desirable to remove any holds before upgrading. If any
          package that is essential for the upgrade is on hold, the upgrade
          will fail. You can identify packages on hold with
 
          <example>

          <p>If you changed and recompiled a package locally, and didn't

          <p>It is important that the <file>/etc/rcS.d</file> directory
          exists prior to the upgrade; the installation of the
          <package/libc6/ package will fail otherwise.</p>

          <p>The <file>/usr/share/doc</file> directory (if it exists
          already) should not be a symlink (e.g. to <file>/usr/doc</file>),
          since that will cause some packages to break. However, symlinking
          <file>/usr/doc</file> to <file>/usr/share/doc</file> is allowed. 
          Please note that if you use such a symlink there will be numerous
          messages about <file>/usr/doc</file> directories that can't be
          removed. Those are normal, and you can safely ignore them.</p></sect1></sect>


        <sect id="upgrade-process"><heading>Preparing Sources for APT</heading>

          <p>The recommended method of upgrading is to use the <prgn/apt/
          method with <prgn/dselect/, as described here. The built-in
          dependency analysis enables smooth upgrades and easy
          installations.</p>

          <p>You should <em/not/ be doing any major package upgrades with
          access methods other than <prgn/apt/ in <prgn/dselect/, because
          those, unlike the <prgn/apt/ method, do not do any logical package
          ordering during the installation, and therefore aren't as
          reliable. Additionally, such upgrades are not well tested and are
          unsupported by Debian.</p>

          <p>Any package installation operation must be run with superuser
          privileges, so either login as root or use <prgn/su/ or
          <prgn/sudo/ to gain the necessary access rights.</p>

          <p>Before starting the upgrade you must set up <package/apt/'s
          configuration file for package lists,
          <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file>.</p>
          
          <p><package/apt/ will consider all packages that can be found via
          any "<tt>deb</tt>" line, and install the package with the highest
          version number, giving priority to the first mentioned lines (that
          way, in case of multiple mirror locations, you'd typically first
          name a local harddisk, then CD-ROMs, and then HTTP/FTP
          mirrors).</p>

           <p>The default configuration is set up for installation from main
           Debian Internet servers, but you may wish to modify
           <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> to use other mirrors,
           preferably a mirror that is network-wise closest to you.</p>

           <p>Otherwise, Debian HTTP or FTP mirror addresses can be found at
           <url id="&url-debian-mirrors;"> (look at the "Full list of
           mirrors" section). HTTP mirrors are generally speedier than ftp
           mirrors.</p>

           <p>For example, suppose your closest Debian mirror is
           <tt>&url-debian-mirror-eg;/</tt>. When inspecting that mirror
           with a web browser or FTP program, you will notice that the main
           directories are organized like this:

           <example>
           
             &url-debian-mirror-eg;/dists/&releasename;/main/binary-&architecture;/...
             &url-debian-mirror-eg;/dists/&releasename;/contrib/binary-&architecture;/...
       
           </example></p>

           <p>To use this mirror with <prgn/apt/, you add this line to your
           <file/sources.list/ file:

           <example>
           
             deb &url-debian-mirror-eg; &releasename; main contrib
 
           </example></p>

           <p>Note that the `<tt>dists</tt>' is added implicitly, and the
           arguments after the release name are used to expand the path into
           multiple directories.</p>

           <p>After adding your new sources, disable the previously existing
           "<tt/deb/" lines in <file/sources.list/, by placing a hash sign
           (<tt/#/) in front of them.</p>

           <p>Any package needed for installation that is fetched from the
           network is stored in the <file>/var/cache/apt/archives</file>
           (and the <file>partial/</file> subdirectory, during download), so
           you must make sure you have enough space before attempting to
           start the installation. With a reasonably extended Debian
           installation, you can expect at least 300 MB of downloaded
           data.</p>

          mount point (the exact <file>/cdrom</file> mount point is required
          for <prgn/apt-cdrom/).For example, if <file>/dev/hdc</file> is

        <sect id="dselectupgrade"><heading>Upgrading using dselect</heading>
          
          <p>The recommended method for upgrading to &debian; &release; is
          using the package management tool <prgn>dselect</prgn>. This tool
          makes safer decisions about packages than <prgn>apt-get</prgn>.</p>
          
          <p>If <prgn>dselect</prgn> is not installed please install the
          version supplied with your release of &debian;.</p>

          <p>The access method for the archive (using APT) has already been
          configured, you can change this configuration however using the
          "[A]ccess" method on the menu. If you are happy with your access
          configuration proceed to the next stage by selecting "[U]pdate"
          from the menu. This will update the package database.</p>
          
          <p>If no problems occured with the update stage, choose "[S]elect"
          from the menu, <prgn>dselect</prgn> will examine the available
          packages and intelligently decide which packages need upgrading
          and which new packages need to be installed to compliment the
          upgrades. It will also suggest packages that should be removed.
          Hitting return at the package selection screen will either give
          you a conflict/dependency resolution screen (at which you may have
          to change selections and press return again) or return you to the
          main menu. Help on the package selection stage is available by
          pressing "?".</p>

          <p>Now that the package selections have been decided it is
          necessary to install any new packages, to do this choose
          "[I]nstall" from the main menu. This will download and install the
          packages using APT from your prefered medium. Go and have a nice
          cup of Earl Grey, this is going to take some time.</p>

          <p>The final two stages are "[C]onfig" and "[R]emove" which will
          finish the upgrade process by configuring the new packages and
          removing any redudant packages</p>

        <sect id="aptupgrade"><heading>Upgrading using apt-get directly (not recommended)</heading>

          <p>Don't forget to mount all needed partitions (notably the root
          and <file>/usr</file> partitions) read-write, with a command
          like:

          <example>
            mount -o remount,rw /<var>mountpoint</var>
          </example></p>

          <p>Assuming you have already configured <package/apt/'s
          <file/sources.list/ as explained above, run (as root):

          <example>
            apt-get update
          </example></p>

          <p>This will resynchronize the package overview files from their
          sources, updating information about new and updated packages.</p>

          <p>It is strongly recommended that you use the
          <prgn>/usr/bin/script</prgn> program to record a transcript of the
          upgrade session. Then if any problems develop, you will have a log
          of what happened, and if needed, can provide exact information in
          a bug report. To start the recording, type:

          <example>
            script -a ~/upgrade-to-woody.typescript
          </example></p>

          <p>or similar. Do not put the typescript file in a temporary
          directory such as <file>/tmp</file> or <file>/var/tmp</file>
          (files in those directories may be deleted during the upgrade or
          during any restart).</p>
          
          <p>It is important to upgrade apt, dpkg and debconf before you do
          the majority of the upgrade. Apt has been considerably improved
          since the previous releases. Debconf is an essential tool which is
          in extensive use in recent packages.

          <example>
            apt-get install dpkg apt debconf
          </example></p>

          <p>This will install the newest versions of <package/dpkg/,
          <package/apt/ and <package/debconf/, which are needed for the rest
          of the upgrade. It will also upgrade some necessary system
          libraries to the latest version.</p>

          <p>When debconf asks about the kind of questions to ask, do not
          choose 'critical', or else you will miss important questions.</p>

<!-- i.e. libc6 and libstdc++ that dpkg and apt depend on - JAB -->


          <p>Some people prefer to first rehearse the upgrade using

          <example>
            apt-get --fix-broken --show-upgraded --simulate dist-upgrade | pager
          </example></p>

          <p>While this may be somewhat time consuming, it may avoid some
          surprises. This will tell you either what's wrong with your system
          (and how to solve it), or, most likely, what exactly will be done
          during the upgrade. Pay special attention to the packages that
          will be "REMOVED"; no essential packages should be listed
          there.</p>

          <p>After you have verified that <prgn/apt-get/ should work fine,
          run:

          <example>
            apt-get --fix-broken --show-upgraded dist-upgrade
          </example></p>

          <p>This will perform a complete upgrade of the system, i.e. 
          install the newest available versions of all packages, and resolve
          all possible dependency changes between packages in different
          releases.  If necessary, it will install some new packages
          (usually new library versions, or renamed packages), and remove
          any conflicting obsoleted packages.</p>

          <p>When upgrading from a set of CD-ROMs, you will be asked to
          insert specific CDs at several points during the upgrade. You
          might have to insert the same CD multiple times; this is due to
          inter-related packages that have been spread out over the CDs.</p>
   
          <p>New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be
          upgraded without changing the install status of another package
          will be left at their current version (displayed as "held back"). 
          Therefore, it may be necessary to use <prgn/dpkg/ or
          <prgn/dselect/ to remove and reinstall some broken packages or
          dependencies.  Alternatively, <tt>apt-get dselect-upgrade</tt> may
          be used after <tt>apt-get -f dist-upgrade</tt>.(See the <manref
          name="apt-get" section="8"> man page.)</p>
  
          <p>The <tt/--fix-broken/ (or just <tt/-f/) option causes
          <package/apt/ to attempt to correct a system with broken
          dependencies in place. <package/apt/ does not allow broken package
          dependencies to exist on a system.</p>
 
        <sect1 id="trouble"><heading>Possible Issues During or After Upgrade</heading>

          <p>Sometimes it's necessary to enable APT::Force-LoopBreak option
          in APT to be able to temporarily remove an essential package due
          to a Conflicts/Pre-Depends loop. <prgn/apt-get/ will alert you of
          this and abort the upgrade. You can work around that by specifying
          <tt>-o APT::Force-LoopBreak=1</tt> option on <prgn/apt-get/
          command line.</p>

          <p>It is possible that a system's dependency structure can be so
          corrupt as to require manual intervention. Usually this means
          using <prgn/dselect/ or

          <example>
          
            dpkg --remove <var>packagename</var>
          
          </example></p>

          <p>to eliminate some of the offending packages, or
 
          <example>

            apt-get --fix-broken --show-upgraded install
            dpkg --configure --pending

          </example></p>

          <p>In extreme cases you might have to force re-installation with a
          command like

          <example>

            dpkg --install /path/to/packagename.deb

          </example></p>

          <p>After fixing things up, you should be able to resume the
          upgrade by repeating the previously described <tt/dist-upgrade/
          commands.</p>

          <p>During the upgrade, you will be asked questions to configure or
          re-configure several packages. When you are asked if any file in
          the <file>/etc/init.d</file> or <file>/etc/terminfo</file>
          directories, or the <file>/etc/manpath.config</file> file should
          be replaced by the package maintainer's version, it's usually
          necessary to answer `yes' to ensure system consistency. You can
          always revert to the old versions, since they will be saved with a
          <tt/.dpkg-old/ extension.</p>

          <p>If you're not sure what to do, write down the name of the
          package or file, and sort things out at a later time. You can
          search in the typescript file to review the information that
          was on the screen during the upgrade.</p></sect1>

        <sect1 id="nownownow"><heading>ToDo Before the Next Reboot</heading>

          <p>When <tt>apt-get dist-upgrade</tt> has finished, the
          "formal" upgrade is complete, but there are some other things
          that should be taken care of <em/before/ the next reboot.</p>

          <p>Most importantly, packages <package/locales/ and
          <package/util-linux/ may need to be installed. This can be done
          with:

          <example>
            apt-get install locales util-linux
          </example></p>

          <p>If you were upgrading from Debian version 2.0 or earlier, this
          will remove the <package/getty/ package, because <prgn/getty/ is
          now in the <package/util-linux/ package.</p>

<![ %powerpc [ 

          <p> On &arch-title;, upgrading to woody involves changing from ADB
          to linux keycodes. You were undoubtedly warned about the issue
          when <package/console-data/ was upgraded. If you are continuing to
          use an ADB-keymapped kernel, you will need to change your boot
          arguments to allow the linux keycodes to become effective when you
          reboot. Details are at <url id="&url-ports;keycodes">.</p>

]]> 

          <p>There probably are several more packages that need to be
          installed, that are not noticed by <prgn/apt-get/, because
          <prgn/apt-get/ doesn't automatically select the packages that
          aren't depended on by other packages (e.g. all packages in
          Recommends: and Suggests: fields). These can quite easily be found
          when using <prgn/dselect/ or another visual frontend. In
          <prgn/dselect/, pick the `apt' method in the [A]ccess screen (if
          you haven't already) and update the database with new packages
          information, using the [U]pdate option. After that, in the
          [S]elect screen, press `o', `o', `v' and Shift-d, and then search
          for the

          <example>
          
            --- Obsolete and local packages present on system ---
          
          </example></p>

<!-- Some potato examples would be better; maybe I can provide some at
a later time - JAB -->

          <p>header. In that section, all such packages will be shown. For
          example, the old <package/gimp/ package has been replaced by
          <package/gimp1.2/. You can either install the new package via
          <prgn/dselect/ (which will then show a ``dependency conflict
          resolution'' screen indicating that the old packages should be
          removed), or by using:

          <example>
 
            apt-get install gimp1.2

          </example></p>

          <p>which will remove the older versions at once (you might just need to
          confirm).</p>

          <p>Another example, that is often not shown even in
          <prgn/dselect/, are the telnet and talk clients and servers, and
          the NFS server, which were split off from the old <package/netstd/
          package. You can install them with a command like:

          <example>
            apt-get install telnet telnetd talk talkd nfs-server
          </example></p>

          <p>The same applies to <package/manpages-dev/, which was split off
          from <package/manpages/.</p>

          <p>Please refer to the Release Notes document for previous
          releases of &debian; for more information about packages that were
          split in that release; go back and read <ref id="renames"> and

         <p>If you were upgrading from a &debian; version 1.x (i.e.  lower
         than 2.0), the old system was using the `libc5' library, while the
         upgraded system uses the `libc6' version. The new library has
         changed the format for the <file/utmp/ and <file/wtmp/ files; you
         can check this by trying the <prgn/last/ command. To solve this, a
         reboot is necessary, but first copy the old file and empty the
         existing ones, with these commands:

         <example>
           
           cd /var/log
           mv wtmp wtmp.libc5

           cd /var/run
           cp /dev/null utmp

         <p>Then reboot the system (note: this is <em/not/ necessary for
         upgrades from Debian release 2.0 and higher!). Once rebooted, the
         <prgn/last/ command will show correct data again.</p>

         <p>Note that the Linux kernel was <em/not/ upgraded by these
         procedures.You may wish to do so yourself, either by installing one
         of the <package/kernel-image-*/ packages or by compiling a
         customized kernel from sources.</p>
         
         <p>&debian; comes with a &kernelversion; which is in the 2.2 series,
         the older stable Linux kernel series. You may wish to use a 2.4
         series kernel for better hardware support or improved
         performace. Booting the third cdrom will do this automagically or
         you can use install a prebuilt one.

         <example>
           apt-get install kernel-image-2.4.18-{386,586tsc,686}
         </example></p>

        <p>Between releases 2.2 (`potato') and 3.0 (`woody'), a number of
        packages have been split into two or more packages. The reason for
        these splits, in general, is that the original package provided a
        diverse set of functionalities, and that few, if any, users used
        all of these components.Some packages will display a notice
        warning of the split during the installation, some mention it in
        the package description, and some just ignore it.</p>

        <p>If you find that a familiar package is lacking some or all of
        its functionality, check the list below to see if you need to
        install additional packages to restore the original functionality. 
        Failing that, check the changelog for the package, which can be
        found in
        <file>/usr/share/doc/<var>package</var>/changelog.Debian.gz</file>.</p>
