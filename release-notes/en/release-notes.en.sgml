        old, you might wish to download the latest version.]</p>

        <p>Please note that previous editions of the release notes contained
        information about upgrading from releases older than than the previous
        release. However such content often complicated the documentation so we
        have decided to only discuss upgrades from &debian; 3.0 ('woody'). If
        you need to upgrade from older releases please read previous editions of
        the release notes.</p>

          <p>This is only the second official release of &debian; for the
          &arch-title; architecture. We feel that it has proven itself
          sufficiently to be released. However, because it has not had the
          exposure (and hence testing by users) that our other releases on
          other architectures have had, you may encounter a few bugs. Please
          use our <url id="&url-bts;" name="bug tracking system"> to report
          any problems; make sure to mention the fact that the bug is on the
          &architecture; platform.</p>

        <sect id="newinst"><heading>What's New in the Installation System?</heading>

          <p>The old &debian; installation system has been replaced by a
          completely new installation system called
          <prgn>debian-installer</prgn>. The new installation system is
          modular in design and so has been developed with extensibility in
          mind.</p>
          
          <p>Some of the new features in the installation system include
          support for booting off USB flash devices, choosing
          <prgn>aptitude</prgn> to install packages in the first-boot stage
          and support for the <prgn>XFS</prgn> file system and
          <prgn>LVM</prgn> (a volume management tool.)</p>

          <p>For full details of the new Debian installation system, users
          are advised to read the Debian installation guide included on the
          first CD or at <url id="&url-install-manual;"></p>

<![ %i386 [ 

          <p>Kernel images are available in various "flavours". These
          flavors each support a different set of hardware. The flavors
          available in &debian; &release; for &arch-title; are:</p>

          <p>
            <taglist>
              <tag>vanilla</tag>
              <item><p>The standard kernel package available in Debian. This
              includes almost all drivers supported by Linux built as
              modules. Including drivers for network devices, SCSI devices,
              sound cards, Video4Linux devices, etc. The
             `vanilla' flavour includes one boot, one root and two
              driver disks.</p></item>
              
              <tag>speakup</tag>
              <item><p>This is almost the same as the vanilla kernel above
              but with support for braille displays. A complete list of
              supported models may be found in the brltty documentation.
              This flavour includes one boot, one root and one driver floppy
              disk image.<p></item>
             
            </taglist>

<![ %available-2.6 [
          <p>An installer using a 2.6 based kernel is available for
          &arch-title;. For more details on how to use it please consult the

        <sect id="newdistro"><heading>What's New in the Distribution?</heading> 
           
           <p>To replace the aging, much-maligned, yet still popular
           <package>dselect</package>, many apt frontends have been in
           development during the woody release cycle. Interested users
           should investigate the <package>aptitude</package> and
           <package>synaptic</package> packages.</p>
       
           <p>This release of &debian; contains the much improved XFree86
           4.3 release, which includes support for a greater range of
           hardware, better autodetection support, and improved support for
           advanced technologies such as Xinerama and 3D acceleration.</p>
           
           <p>&debian; is more desktop orientated than ever in this new release,
           it now includes GNOME 2.6 and KDE 3.2. Also included for the
           first time is a complete office suite in the form of OpenOffice.Org
           1.1, other productivity tools included in the release are the
           Evolution groupware software and GAIM instant messaging client.
           
           <p>The official &debian; distribution now ships on thirteen
           binary CDs with a similar number of source CDs, and a DVD version
           of the distribution is now also available.</p></sect>

      <chapt id="installing"><heading>New Installations</heading>

        <p>If you are making a new installation of Debian, you should read
        the installation manual, which is available on the Official CD at:

        <example>        
          /dists/&releasename;/main/disks-&architecture;/current/doc/install.txt
          (or .html)
        
        </example></p>

        <p>or on the Internet at: <url id="&url-install-manual;"></p>

        <p>The old &debian; installation system called
        <prgn>boot-floppies</prgn> has been replaced by a new componentized and
        more powerful installation system called <prgn>debian-installer</prgn>.</p>

       	<sect1 id="syntax"><heading>Important program syntax changes</heading>
       	  <p>Debian attempts to avoid changing upstream packages, therefore
          changes in the original packages will be present in &debian;</p>

          <p><em>No changes yet reported.</em></p>
        
        </sect1>
        
        </sect>
        <sect id="backup"><heading>Preparing for the Upgrade</heading>

          <p>Before upgrading your system, it is strongly recommended that
          you make a full backup, or at least backup any data or
          configuration information you can't afford to lose. The upgrade
          tools and process are quite reliable, but a hardware failure in
          the middle of an upgrade could result in a severely damaged
          system.</p>

          <p>The main things you'll want to back up are the contents of
          <file>/etc</file>, <file>/var/lib/dpkg</file> and the output of
          <tt>dpkg --get-selections \*</tt>.</p>

          <p>It's wise to inform all users in advance of any upgrades you're
          planning, although users accessing your system via ssh (at least)
          shouldn't notice much during the upgrade, and may want to continue
          working. If you wish to take extra precautions, back up or unmount
          user's partitions (<file>/home</file>) before upgrading. A reboot
          will not normally be necessary.</p>

          <p>Distribution upgrade should be done either locally from a
          textmode virtual console (or a directly connected serial
          terminal), or remotely via an <prgn/ssh/ link.</p>

          <p><em/Important/: You should <em/not/ upgrade using
          <prgn/telnet/, <prgn/rlogin/, <prgn/rsh/, or from an X session
          managed by <prgn/xdm/ on the machine you are upgrading. That is
          because each of those services may well be terminated during the
          upgrade, which can result in an <em/inaccessible/ system that is
          only half-upgraded.</p>

	<sect1><heading>Disabling APT Pinning</heading>

	  <p>If you have configured APT to install certain packages from a
	  distribution other than stable (e.g from testing) you may have to
	  change your APT pinning configuration (stored in
	  <file>/etc/apt/preferences</file> to allow the upgrade of packages to
	  the versions in the new stable release. Further information on APT
	  pinning can be found in <manref name="apt_preferences" section="5">.</p>

	</sect1>
	
        <sect1><heading>Checking Packages Status</heading>

          <p>Regardless of the method used for upgrading, it is recommended
          that you check the status of all packages first, and verify that
          all packages are in an upgradable state. The following command
          will show any packages which have a status of Half-Installed or
          Failed-Config, and those with any error status.

          <example>
        
            # dpkg --audit
          
          </example></p>
 
          <p>You could also inspect the state of all packages on your system
          using <prgn/dselect/, <prgn/aptitude/, or with commands such as

          <example>
         
            # dpkg -l | pager 

          </example></p>

          <p>or

          <example>
         
            # dpkg --get-selections &gt; ~/curr-pkgs.txt

          </example></p>

          <p>It is desirable to remove any holds before upgrading. If any
          package that is essential for the upgrade is on hold, the upgrade
          will fail. You can identify packages on hold with
 
          <example>
         
            # dpkg --audit
       
          </example></p>

          <p>If you changed and recompiled a package locally, and didn't
          rename it or put an epoch in the version, you must put it on hold
          to prevent it from being upgraded. The `hold' package state can be
	  changed either by using <prgn/aptitude/. With 
	  
	  <example>
	  aptitude hold | unhold &lt;package&gt;
	  </example>
	  </p></sect1>

        <sect1><heading>Special Considerations for SSH Users</heading>

          <p>The commercial SSH located in the <package/ssh/ package before
          release 2.2 or in the <package/ssh-nonfree/ in release 2.2 has
          been replaced by the DFSG free <package/ssh/ package (OpenSSH) in
          this release. The commercial SSH collection is no longer present. 
          The <package/ssh/ package includes a Debconf question which will
          regenerate a configuration which is OpenSSH compatible.</p>
          
        <sect1><heading>Directories Possibly Needing Attention</heading>

          <p>It is important that the <file>/etc/rcS.d</file> directory
          exists prior to the upgrade; the installation of the
          <package/libc6/ package will fail otherwise.</p>

          <p>The <file>/usr/share/doc</file> directory (if it exists
          already) should not be a symlink (e.g. to <file>/usr/doc</file>),
          since that will cause some packages to break. However, symlinking
          <file>/usr/doc</file> to <file>/usr/share/doc</file> is allowed. 
          Please note that if you use such a symlink there will be numerous
          messages about <file>/usr/doc</file> directories that can't be
          removed. Those are normal, and you can safely ignore them.</p></sect1></sect>


        <sect id="upgrade-process"><heading>Preparing Sources for APT</heading>

	  <p>The recommended method of upgrading is to use <prgn/aptitude/, as
	  described here. The built-in dependency analysis enables smooth
	  upgrades and easy installations.</p>
	  
	  <p>Any package installation operation must be run with superuser
          privileges, so either login as root or use <prgn/su/ or
          <prgn/sudo/ to gain the necessary access rights.</p>

          <p>Before starting the upgrade you must set up <package/apt/'s
          configuration file for package lists,
          <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file>.</p>
          
          <p><package/apt/ will consider all packages that can be found via
          any "<tt>deb</tt>" line, and install the package with the highest
          version number, giving priority to the first mentioned lines (that
          way, in case of multiple mirror locations, you'd typically first
          name a local harddisk, then CD-ROMs, and then HTTP/FTP
          mirrors).</p>

         <sect1 id="network"><heading>Adding APT Internet Sources</heading>

           <p>The default configuration is set up for installation from main
           Debian Internet servers, but you may wish to modify
           <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> to use other mirrors,
           preferably a mirror that is network-wise closest to you.</p>

           <p>Otherwise, Debian HTTP or FTP mirror addresses can be found at
           <url id="&url-debian-mirrors;"> (look at the "Full list of
           mirrors" section). HTTP mirrors are generally speedier than ftp
           mirrors.</p>

           <p>For example, suppose your closest Debian mirror is
           <tt>&url-debian-mirror-eg;/</tt>. When inspecting that mirror
           with a web browser or FTP program, you will notice that the main
           directories are organized like this:

           <example>
           
             &url-debian-mirror-eg;/dists/stable/main/binary-&architecture;/...
             &url-debian-mirror-eg;/dists/stable/contrib/binary-&architecture;/...
       
           </example></p>

           <p>To use this mirror with <prgn/apt/, you add this line to your
           <file/sources.list/ file:

           <example>
           
             deb &url-debian-mirror-eg; &releasename; main contrib
 
           </example></p>

           <p>Note that the `<tt>dists</tt>' is added implicitly, and the
           arguments after the release name are used to expand the path into
           multiple directories.</p>

           <p>After adding your new sources, disable the previously existing
           "<tt/deb/" lines in <file/sources.list/, by placing a hash sign
           (<tt/#/) in front of them.</p>

           <p>Any package needed for installation that is fetched from the
           network is stored in the <file>/var/cache/apt/archives</file>
           (and the <file>partial/</file> subdirectory, during download), so
           you must make sure you have enough space before attempting to
           start the installation. With a reasonably extended Debian
           installation, you can expect at least 300 MB of downloaded
           data.</p>
           
         </sect1>

         <sect1 id="localmirror"><heading>Adding APT Local Mirror Sources</heading>

           <p>Instead of using HTTP or FTP packages mirrors, you may wish to
           modify <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> to use a mirror on a
           local disk (possibly NFS-mounted).</p>

           <p>For example, your packages mirror may be under
           <file>/var/ftp/debian/</file>, and have main directories like
           this:

           <example>
           
             /var/ftp/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-&architecture;/...
             /var/ftp/debian/dists/stable/contrib/binary-&architecture;/...
           
           </example></p>

           <p>To use this with <prgn/apt/, add this line to your
           <file/sources.list/ file:

           <example>
             deb file:/var/ftp/debian &releasename; main contrib
           </example></p>

           <p>Note that the `<tt>dists</tt>' is added implicitly, and the
           arguments after the release name are used to expand the path into
           multiple directories.</p>

          <p>After adding your new sources, disable the previously
          existing "<tt/deb/" lines in <file/sources.list/, by placing a
          hash sign (<tt/#/) in front of them.</p></sect1>

        <sect1 id="cdroms"><heading>Adding APT CD-ROM Sources</heading>

          <p>See above if you need to first install the latest version of
          <package/apt/ and <package/dpkg/ packages, as described above.</p>

          <p>If you want to use CDs <em/only/, comment out the existing
          "<tt/deb/" lines in <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> by placing
          a hash sign (<tt/#/) in front of them.</p>

          <p>Make sure there is a line in <file>/etc/fstab</file> that
          enables mounting your CD-ROM drive at the <file>/cdrom</file>
          mount point (the exact <file>/cdrom</file> mount point is required
          for <prgn/apt-cdrom/).For example, if <file>/dev/hdc</file> is
          your CD-ROM drive, <file>/etc/fstab</file> should contain a line
          like:

          <example>
             
             /dev/hdc /cdrom auto defaults,noauto,ro 0 0
             
          </example></p>

          <p>Note that there must be <em/no spaces/ between the words
          <tt>defaults,noauto,ro</tt> in the fourth field.</p>

          <p>To verify it works, insert a CD and try running

          <example>
 
            mount /cdrom (this will mount the CD to the mount point)

	<sect id="upgradingpackages"><heading>Upgrading packages</heading>
	  
	  <p>The recommended tool for upgrading between &debian; releases is
	  to use the package management tool <prgn>aptitude</prgn>. This tool
	  makes safer decisions about package installations than running
	  <prgn>apt-get</prgn> directly.</p>
	  
	  <p>Don't forget to mount all needed partitions (notably the root
          and <file>/usr</file> partitions) read-write, with a command
          like:

          <example>
            mount -o remount,rw /<var>mountpoint</var>
          </example></p>

	  <p>Next ensure that the APT source entries (in
	  <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file>) refer to the <tt>'stable'</tt>
	  distribution and does not refer to it by its codename (e.g.
	  <tt>&oldreleasename;</tt>).
	  
	  <p>It is strongly recommended that you use the
	  <prgn>/usr/bin/script</prgn> program to record a transcript of the
	  upgrade session. Then if any problems develop, you will have a log of
	  what happened, and if needed, can provide exact information in a bug
	  report. To start the recording, type:

          <example>
            script -a ~/upgrade-to-sarge.typescript
          </example></p>

	  <p>or similar. Do not put the typescript file in a temporary
	  directory such as <file>/tmp</file> or <file>/var/tmp</file> (files
	  in those directories may be deleted during the upgrade or during any
	  restart).</p>
 
	  <p>Next the <package>aptitude</package> package needs to be installed.
	  This is done with:</p> 
	  
	  <p><example>
	  apt-get install aptitude
	  </example></p>

	  <p>Provided that you have a working APT configuration as described
	  above this will install the &oldreleasename; version of
	  <prgn>aptitude</prgn>.</p>

	  <p>First <prgn>aptitude</prgn> needs to fetch a list of new and
	  updated packages for the new release. This is done by executing:</p>
	  
	  <p><example>
	  aptitude update
	  </example></p>

	  <p>Once <prgn>aptitude</prgn> has information on all the available
	  packages the system is almost ready to be fully upgraded.</p>

	  <p><example>
	  aptitude -f --with-suggests --with-recommends dist-upgrade
	  </example></p>

	  <p>This will perform a complete upgrade of the system, i.e.  install
	  the newest available versions of all packages, and resolve all
	  possible dependency changes between packages in different releases.
	  If necessary, it will install some new packages (usually new library
	  versions, or renamed packages), and remove any conflicting obsoleted
	  packages (such as <package>console-tools-libs</package>).</p>

          <p>When upgrading from a set of CD-ROMs, you will be asked to
          insert specific CDs at several points during the upgrade. You
          might have to insert the same CD multiple times; this is due to
          inter-related packages that have been spread out over the CDs.</p>
   
	  <p>New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be
	  upgraded without changing the install status of another package will
	  be left at their current version (displayed as "held back"). This can
	  be resolved by either using <prgn>aptitude</prgn> to choose these
	  packages for installation or by trying <tt>aptitude -f install
	  &lt;package&gt;</tt>.</p>
            
          <p>The <tt/--fix-broken/ (or just <tt/-f/) option causes
          <package/apt/ to attempt to correct a system with broken
          dependencies in place. <package/apt/ does not allow broken package
          dependencies to exist on a system.</p>

        <sect1 id="trouble"><heading>Possible Issues During or After Upgrade</heading>

          <p>Sometimes it's necessary to enable APT::Force-LoopBreak option
          in APT to be able to temporarily remove an essential package due
          to a Conflicts/Pre-Depends loop. <prgn/aptitude/ will alert you of
          this and abort the upgrade. You can work around that by specifying
          <tt>-o APT::Force-LoopBreak=1</tt> option on <prgn/aptitude/
          command line.</p>

          <p>It is possible that a system's dependency structure can be so
          corrupt as to require manual intervention. Usually this means
          using <prgn/aptitude/ or

          <example>
          
            dpkg --remove <var>packagename</var>
          
          </example></p>

          <p>to eliminate some of the offending packages, or
 
          <example>

            aptitude --fix-broken install
            dpkg --configure --pending

          </example></p>

          <p>In extreme cases you might have to force re-installation with a
          command like

          <example>

            dpkg --install /path/to/packagename.deb

          </example></p>

          <p>After fixing things up, you should be able to resume the
          upgrade by repeating the previously described <tt/dist-upgrade/
          commands.</p>

          <p>During the upgrade, you will be asked questions to configure or
          re-configure several packages. When you are asked if any file in
          the <file>/etc/init.d</file> or <file>/etc/terminfo</file>
          directories, or the <file>/etc/manpath.config</file> file should
          be replaced by the package maintainer's version, it's usually
          necessary to answer `yes' to ensure system consistency. You can
          always revert to the old versions, since they will be saved with a
          <tt/.dpkg-old/ extension.</p>

          <p>If you're not sure what to do, write down the name of the
          package or file, and sort things out at a later time. You can
          search in the typescript file to review the information that
          was on the screen during the upgrade.</p></sect1>

          <p>When <tt>aptitude dist-upgrade</tt> has finished, the
          "formal" upgrade is complete, but there are some other things
          that should be taken care of <em/before/ the next reboot.</p>
          
          <p>Please refer to the Release Notes document for previous
          releases of &debian; for more information about packages that were
          split in that release; go back and read <ref id="renames"> and

	  of the <package/kernel-image-*/ packages or by compiling a customized
	  kernel from sources.</p> 
	  
	  <![ %available-2.6 [

	 <p>&debian; comes with a &kernelversion; kernel which is in the 2.4
	 series, the older stable Linux kernel series. You may wish to use a 2.6
	 series kernel for better hardware support or improved performance.</p>
         
]]>
         
         <p>To upgrade your kernel you must first choose the kernel most
         apropriate for your subarchitecture. A list of kernels available for

         <example>
           
           apt-cache search ^kernel-image

         </example></p>
         
         <p>You should then use <tt/aptitude install/ to install it. Once
         this new kernel is installed you should reboot at the next available
         oppurtunity to get the benefit.</p>

         <p>For the more adventurous there is an easy way to compile your
         own custom kernel on &debian;. Install the

      <sect id="splits"><heading>Split Packages</heading>
          
        <p>Between releases 3.0 (`woody') and  &release; (`sarge'), a number of
        packages have been split into two or more packages. The reason for
        these splits, in general, is that the original package provided a
        diverse set of functionalities, and that few, if any, users used
        all of these components.Some packages will display a notice
        warning of the split during the installation, some mention it in
        the package description, and some just ignore it.</p>

        <p>If you find that a familiar package is lacking some or all of
        its functionality, check the list below to see if you need to
        install additional packages to restore the original functionality. 
        Failing that, check the changelog for the package, which can be
        found in
        <file>/usr/share/doc/<var>package</var>/changelog.Debian.gz</file>.</p>

        <p>The following is a list of packages that have been split (this
