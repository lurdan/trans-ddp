DocBook XML which allows the creation of various output files in the
formats HTML, text, PDF, ...

Building the RN
---------------

To build it you need these packages:
 - docbook-xsl         (transformation stylesheets)
 - libxml2-utils       (for xmllint)
 - dblatex and xmlroff (depending on the output format and language)
 - po4a                (for handling PO file based translations)
 - make                (or you will type a lot)
 - ttf-arphic-*        (fonts)
 - texlive-*           (used by dblatex)
 - w3m                 (to create the text version)

For etch, you need the lenny backports of dblatex and xmlroff.

Just call "make" to build it. To build the release notes in a single
format (html or txt or pdf) for a single language (e.g. zh_CN, en, es)
and the "all" pseudo-architecture, call e.g.:
"make html LINGUA=es architecture=all".

Autobuilding of the RN
----------------------

The Release Notes are automatically built at www-master.debian.org 
in order to publish them at http://www.debian.org/ and all the mirrors
around the world.

An automatic task updates the www-master SVN copy to the latest revision
and builds the Release Notes for different releases.

Build logs are available at 
   http://www-master.debian.org/build-logs/webwml/release-notes.log


The automatic task that runs the build is:
http://cvs.debian.org/webwml/cron/parts/7release-notes?view=log 
which is called by the 'often' task at www-master:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
# m h  dom mon dow   command
24 3,7,11,15,19,23 * * * /srv/www.debian.org/cron/often
