Release Notes

The Release Notes contain important information for new users and for
an update from the previous version of Debian. It is written in
DocBook XML which allows the creation of various output files in the
formats HTML, text, PDF, ...

To build it you need these packages:
 - docbook-xsl         (transformation stylesheets)
 - libxml2-utils       (for xmllint)
 - dblatex and xmlroff (depending on the output format and language)
 - po4a                (for handling PO file based translations)
 - make                (or you will type a lot)
 - ttf-arphic-*        (fonts)
 - texlive-*           (used by dblatex)
 - w3m                 (to create the text version)

For etch, you need the lenny backports of dblatex and xmlroff.

Just call "make" to build it. To build the release notes in a single
format (html or txt or pdf) for a single language (e.g. zh_CN, en, es)
and a single architecture (such as amd64, i386, powerpc), call e.g.:
"make html LINGUA=es architecture=i386".

Translations

The document is available in many languages. po4a is currently used as
the translation tool.

Some translators prefer full-text translation without po. For this
style of translations, the original English files are just copied
into the language directory and the translators have to make sure,
that the translation is up to date.

To add a new translation, call "make updatepo LINGUA=xx" to create a
new PO template file which you need to translate, with xx being the
language code of your translation.

It is suggested that you now try to create the document for at least
one architecture. This will detect possible syntax errors in your
file. Furthermore you may call "make validate LINGUA=xx".

Send your translation for inclusion to the public mailing list
debian-doc@lists.debian.org.
