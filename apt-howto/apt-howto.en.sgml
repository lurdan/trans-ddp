<abstract>
This document intends to provide the user with a good understanding
of the workings of the Debian package management utility, APT.  Its
goal is to make life easier for new Debian users and to help those
who wish to deepen their understanding of the administration of this
system.  It was created for the Debian project in order to help
improve the support available for users of this distribution.

<chapt>Introduction
<p>
In the beginning there was the .tar.gz.  Users had to compile each program
that they wanted to use on their GNU/Linux systems.  When Debian was created,
it was deemed necessary that the system include a method of managing the
packages installed on the machine.  The name <prgn>dpkg</prgn> was given to
this system.  Thus the famous `package' first came into being on GNU/Linux,
a while before Red Hat decided to create their own `rpm' system.
<p>
A new dilemma quickly took hold of the minds of the makers of
GNU/Linux.  They needed a rapid, practical, and efficient way to install
packages that would manage dependencies automatically and take care of
their configuration files while upgrading.  Here again, Debian led the way
and gave birth to APT, the Advanced Packaging Tool, which has since been
ported by Conectiva for use with rpm and has been adopted by some other
distributions.
<p>
This manual makes no attempt to address apt-rpm, as the Conectiva port of
APT is known, but "patches" to this document which do so would be welcome.
<p>
This manual is based on the next Debian release, <tt>Sarge</tt>.
</chapt>

<chapt id="basico">Basic Configuration

<sect id="sources.list">The /etc/apt/sources.list file
<p>
As part of its operation, APT uses a file that lists the 'sources' from
which packages can be obtained.  This file is <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>.
<p>
The entries in this file normally follow this format:

<example>
deb http://site.http.org/debian distribution section1 section2 section3
deb-src http://site.http.org/debian distribution section1 section2 section3
</example>

Of course, the above entries are fictitious and should not be used.  The
first word on each line, <tt>deb</tt> or <tt>deb-src</tt>, indicates the type
of archive: whether it contains binary packages (<tt>deb</tt>), that is, the
pre-compiled packages that we normally use, or source packages
(<tt>deb-src</tt>), which are the original program sources plus the Debian
control file (<tt>.dsc</tt>) and the <tt>diff.gz</tt> containing the
changes needed for `debianizing' the program.
<p>
We usually find the following in the default Debian sources.list:
<example>
# See sources.list(5) for more information, especialy
# Remember that you can only use http, ftp or file URIs
# CDROMs are managed through the apt-cdrom tool.
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US stable/non-US main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org stable/updates main contrib non-free

# Uncomment if you want the apt-get source function to work
#deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
#deb-src http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US stable non-US
</example>

These are the lines needed by a basic Debian install.  The first <tt>deb</tt>
line points to the official archive, the second to the non-US archive and
the third to the archive of Debian security updates.
<p>
The two last lines are commented out (with a `#' in front), so apt-get will
ignore them.  These are <tt>deb-src</tt> lines, that is, they point to
Debian source packages.  If you often download program sources for testing or
recompiling, uncomment them.
<p>
The <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file can contain several types of lines.
APT knows how to deal with archives of types <tt>http</tt>, <tt>ftp</tt>,
<tt>file</tt> (local files, e.g., a directory containing a mounted ISO9660
filesystem) and <tt>ssh</tt>, that I know of.
<p>
Do not forget to run <tt>apt-get update</tt> after modifying the
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file. You must do this to let
APT obtain the package lists from the sources you specified.
</sect>

<sect id="dpkg-scanpackages">How to use APT locally
<p>
Sometimes you have lots of packages .deb that you would like to use
APT to install so that the dependencies would be automaticaly 
solved.
<p>
To do that create a directory and put the .debs you want to index
in it . For example:
<example>
mkdir /root/debs
</example>
You may modify the definitions set on the package's control file
directly for your repository using an <tt>override</tt> file.
Inside this file you may want to define some options to override
the ones that come with the package. It looks like follows:
<example>
package priority section
</example>
package is the name of the package, priority is low, medium or
high and section is the section to which it belongs. The file
name does not matter, you'll have to pass it as an argument for
<prgn>dpkg-scanpackages</prgn> later. If you do not want to
write an <tt>override</tt> file, just use <file>/dev/null</file>.
when calling <prgn>dpkg-scanpackages</prgn>.
<p>
Still in the /root directory do:
<example>
dpkg-scanpackages debs <var>file</var> | gzip > debs/Packages.gz
</example>
In the above line, <var>file</var> is the <tt>override</tt> file, 
the command generates a file <file>Packages.gz</file> that contains 
various informations about the packages, which are used by APT. To 
use the packages, finally, add:
<example>
deb file:/root debs/
</example>
After that just use the APT commands as usual. You may also generate
a sources repository. To do that use the same procedure,
but remember that you need to have the files <tt>.orig.tar.gz</tt>,
<tt>.dsc</tt> and <tt>.diff.gz</tt> in the directory and you
have to use <tt>Sources.gz</tt> instead of <tt>Packages.gz</tt>. 
The program used is also different. It is <prgn>dpkg-scansources</prgn>. 
The command line will look like this:
<example>
dpkg-scansources debs | gzip > debs/Sources.gz
</example>
Notice that <prgn>dpkg-scansources</prgn> doesn't need an 
<tt>override</tt> file. The sources.list's line is:
<example>
deb-src file:/root debs/
</example>
</sect>

<sect id="netselect">Deciding which mirror is the best to include in the sources.list file: netselect, netselect-apt <p>
A very frequent doubt, mainly among the newest users is: "which Debian
mirror to include in <tt>sources.list</tt>?". There are many ways
to decide which mirror. The experts probably have a script that
measures the ping time through the several mirrors. But there's a
program that does this for us: <strong>netselect</strong>.
<p>
To install netselect, as usual:
<example>
apt-get install netselect
</example>
Executing it without parameters shows the help. Executing it with a
space-separated list of hosts (mirrors), it will return a score and
one of the hosts. This score takes in consideration the estimated ping
time and the hops (hosts by which a network query will pass by to reach
the destination) number and is inversely proportional to the estimated
download speed (so, the lower, the better). The returned host is the
one that had the lowest score (the full list of scores can be seen adding
the -vv option). See this example: <example>
bash$ netselect ftp.debian.org http.us.debian.org ftp.at.debian.org download.unesp.br ftp.debian.org.br
  365 ftp.debian.org.br
bash$
</example>
This means that, from the mirrors included as parameters to netselect,
<tt>ftp.debian.org.br</tt> was the best, with an score of 365. (Attention!!
As it was done on my computer and the network topography is extremely
different depending on the contact point, this value is not necessarily
the right speed in other computers).
<p>
Now, just put the fastest mirror found by netselect in the
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file (see <ref id="sources.list">) and
follow the tips in <ref id="apt-get">.
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> the list of mirrors may always be found in the
file <url id="http://www.debian.org/mirror/mirrors_full"
name="http://www.debian.org/mirror/mirrors_full">. <p>
Beginning with the 0.3 version, netselect package includes the
<strong>netselect-apt</strong> script, which makes the process above
automatic. Just enter the distribution tree as parameter (the default is
stable) and the <tt>sources.list</tt> file will be generated with the best
main and non-US mirrors and will be saved under the current directory. The
following example generates a sources.list of the stable distribution:
<example>
bash$ ls sources.list
ls: sources.list: File or directory not found
bash$ netselect-apt stable
(...)
bash$ ls -l sources.list
sources.list
bash$
</example>
<strong>Remember:</strong> the <tt>sources.list</tt> file is generated
under the current directory, and must be moved to the <tt>/etc/apt</tt>
directory.
<p>
Then, follow the tips in <ref id="apt-get">.
</sect>

<sect id="cdrom">Adding a CD-ROM to the sources.list file
<p>
If you'd rather use your CD-ROM for installing packages or updating
your system automatically with APT, you can put it in your
<tt>sources.list</tt>.  To do so, you can use the <prgn>apt-cdrom</prgn>
program like this:

<example>
apt-cdrom add
</example>

with the Debian CD-ROM in the drive.  It will mount the CD-ROM, and
if it's a valid Debian CD it will look for package information on the
disk.  If your CD-ROM configuration is a little unusual, you
can also use the following options:

<example>
-h           - program help
-d directory - CD-ROM mount point
-r           - Rename a recognized CD-ROM
-m           - No mounting
-f           - Fast mode, don't check package files
-a           - Thorough scan mode
</example>

For example:

<example>
apt-cdrom -d /home/kov/mycdrom add
</example>

You can also identify a CD-ROM, without adding it to your list:

<example>
apt-cdrom ident
</example>

Note that this program only works if your CD-ROM is properly
configured in your system's <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
</sect>

</chapt>


<chapt id="apt-get">Managing packages
<sect id="update">Updating the list of available packages
<p>
The packaging system uses a private database to keep track of which
packages are installed, which are not installed and which are available for
installation.  The <prgn>apt-get</prgn> program uses this database to
find out how to install packages requested by the user and to find out
which additional packages are needed in order for a selected package to
work properly.
<p>
To update this list, you would use the command <prgn>apt-get update</prgn>.
This command looks for the package lists in the archives found in
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>; see <ref id="sources.list"> for more
information about this file.
<p>
It's a good idea to run this command regularly to keep yourself and your
system informed about possible package updates, particularly security
updates.
</sect>

<sect id="install">Installing packages
<p>
Finally, the process you've all been waiting for!  With your sources.list
ready and your list of available packages up to date, all you have to do is
run <tt>apt-get</tt> to get your desired package installed.  For example,
you can run:

<example>
apt-get install xchat
</example>

APT will search it's database for the most recent version of this package and
will retrieve it from the corresponding archive as specified in
<tt>sources.list</tt>.  In the event that this package depends on another --
as is the case here -- APT will check the dependencies and install the
needed packages.  See this example:

<example>
[root]@[/] # apt-get install nautilus
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
The following extra packages will be installed:
  bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 nautilus 
0 packages upgraded, 4 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1  not upgraded.
Need to get 8329kB of archives. After unpacking 17.2MB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 
</example>

The package <package>nautilus</package> depends on the shared libraries cited,
therefore APT will get them from the archive.  If you had
specified the names of these libraries on the <tt>apt-get</tt> command line,
APT would not have asked if you wanted to continue; it would automatically
accept that you wanted to install all of those packages.
<p>
This means that APT only asks for confirmation when it needs to install
packages which weren't specified on the command line.
<p>
The following options to apt-get may be useful:

<example>
-h  This help text.
-d  Download only - do NOT install or unpack archives
-f  Attempt to continue if the integrity check fails
-s  No-act. Perform ordering simulation
-y  Assume Yes to all queries and do not prompt
-u  Show a list of upgraded packages as well
</example>

Multiple packages may be selected for installation in one line.
Files downloaded from the network are placed in the directory
<tt>/var/cache/apt/archives</tt> for later installation.
<p>
You can specify packages to be removed on the same command line, as well.
Just put a '-' immediately after the name of the package to be removed, like
this:

<example>
[root]@[/] # apt-get install nautilus gnome-panel-       
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
The following extra packages will be installed:
  bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  gnome-applets gnome-panel gnome-panel-data gnome-session 
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 nautilus 
0 packages upgraded, 4 newly installed, 4 to remove and 1  not upgraded.
Need to get 8329kB of archives. After unpacking 2594kB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 
</example>

See section <ref id="remove"> for more details on package removal.
<p>
If you somehow damage an installed package, or simply want the files of a
package to be reinstalled with the newest version that is available,
you can use the <tt>--reinstall</tt> option like so:

<example>
[root]@[/] # apt-get --reinstall install gdm
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 reinstalled, 0 to remove and 1  not upgraded.
Need to get 0B/182kB of archives. After unpacking 0B will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
</example>

The version of APT used in the creation of this manual is version 0.5.3,
which was the current version in Debian `unstable' (<tt>sid</tt>) at the time of
writing. If you have this version installed, you have additional
functionality at your disposal: you can use a command of the form
<tt>apt-get install package/distribution</tt> to install a package from a
specific distribution, or <tt>apt-get install package=version</tt>. For
example:

<example>
apt-get install nautilus/unstable
</example>

will install nautilus from the `unstable' distribution even if you
are running `stable'.  The accepted values for 'distribution' are
<tt>stable</tt>, <tt>testing</tt>, and <tt>unstable</tt>.
<p>
You may prefer to use the <tt>-t</tt> switch to select a target
distribution, leading <prgn>apt-get</prgn> to favor that distribution
when resolving dependencies.
<p>
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: the `unstable' version of Debian is the version to
which the newest versions of Debian packages are uploaded first.  This
distribution sees all of the changes that packages go through, both
small ones and more drastic ones which affect many packages or the whole
system.  For this reason, this version of the distribution should
<em>not</em> be used by inexperienced users or by those who need proven
stability.
<p>
The `testing' distribution is a little better than `unstable' with regards to
stability, but for production systems one should use the stable
distribution.
</sect>

<sect id="remove">Removing packages
<p>
If you no longer want to use a package, you can remove it from your system
using APT.  To do this just type: <tt>apt-get remove package</tt>.
For example:

<example>
[root]@[/] # apt-get remove gnome-panel
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  gnome-applets gnome-panel gnome-panel-data gnome-session 
0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 4 to remove and 1  not upgraded.
Need to get 0B of archives. Aution 
is to use <tt>dist-upgrade</tt>.  See section <ref id="dist-upgrade">.
</sect>

<p>
This feature of APT allows you to upgrade an entire Debian system at once,
either through the Internet or from a new CD (purchased or downloaded as
an ISO image).
<p>
It is also used when changes are made to the relationships between installed
packages.  With <tt>apt-get upgrade</tt>, these packages would be kept
untouched (<tt>kept back</tt>).
<p>
Debian and you buy a CD with revision 3. You can use APT to upgrade your
[root]@[/] # apt-get --purge remove gnome-panel
(see section <ref id="cdrom">) to add the CD to your
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> and run <tt>apt-get dist-upgrade</tt>.
<p>
It's important to note that APT always looks for the most recent
versions of packages.  Therefore, if your <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
were to list an archive that had a more recent version of a package than
the version on the CD, APT would download the package from there.
<p>
In the example shown in section <ref id="upgrade">, we saw that
with the <tt>dist-upgrade</tt> method:

<p>
<example>
# apt-get -u dist-upgrade
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done

31 packages upgraded, 10 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
Need to get 0B/7098kB of archives. After unpacking 3118kB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
</example>

Note now that the packages will be upgraded, and new packages will also be
installed (the new dependencies of the packages).  Note too that lilo is
still being <tt>kept back</tt>. It probably has a more serious problem
than a new dependency.  We can find out by running:

<p>
<example>
# apt-get -u install lilo
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
The following extra packages will be installed:
  cron debconf exim libident libopenldap-runtime libopenldap1 libpcre2
  logrotate mailx 
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  debconf-tiny 
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  cron debconf exim libident libopenldap-runtime libopenldap1 libpcre2
  logrotate mailx 
The following packages will be upgraded
  lilo 
1 packages upgraded, 9 newly installed, 1 to remove and 31 not upgraded.
Need to get 225kB/1179kB of archives. After unpacking 2659kB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]

[root]@[/] # apt-get -u upgrade
As noted in the above, lilo has a new conflict with the package
<package>debconf-tiny</package>, which means it couldn't be installed
(or upgraded) without removing debconf-tiny.
<p>
To know what's keeping or removing a package you may use:

<p>
<example>
# apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes dist-upgrade
Reading Package Lists... Done

</example>

<p>
This way, it's easy to notice that the python1.5-dev package cannot
be installed because of an unsatisfied dependency: python1.5.

</sect>

<sect id="clean">Removing unused package files: apt-get clean and autoclean
<p>
When you install a package APT retrieves the needed files from the hosts 
listed in /etc/apt/sources.list, stores them in a local repository
(<file>/var/cache/apt/archives/</file>), and then proceeds with
installation, see <ref id="install">.
<p>
In time the local repository can grow and occupy a lot of disk space.
Fortunately, APT provides tools for managing its local repository:
<prgn>apt-get</prgn>'s <tt>clean</tt> and <tt>autoclean</tt> methods.
<p>
<prgn>apt-get clean</prgn> removes everything except lock files from
<file>/var/cache/apt/archives/</file> and
<file>/var/cache/apt/archives/partial/</file>. Thus, if you need to
reinstall a package APT should retrieve it again.
<p>
<prgn>apt-get autoclean</prgn> removes only package files that can
no longer be downloaded. 
<p>

[root]@[/] # apt-get -u dist-upgrade
<example>
# ls /var/cache/apt/archives/logrotate* /var/cache/apt/archives/gpm*
logrotate_3.5.9-7_i386.deb
logrotate_3.5.9-8_i386.deb
gpm_1.19.6-11_i386.deb
</example>

<p>
In /var/cache/apt/archives there are two files for the
package <package>logrotate</package> and one for the package
<package>gpm</package>.

<p>
<example>
# apt-show-versions -p logrotate
logrotate/stable uptodate 3.5.9-8
# apt-show-versions -p gpm
gpm/stable upgradeable from 1.19.6-11 to 1.19.6-12
</example>
<p>
<prgn>apt-show-versions</prgn> shows that
<file>logrotate_3.5.9-8_i386.deb</file> provides the up to date version
of <package>logrotate</package>, so
<file>logrotate_3.5.9-7_i386.deb</file> is useless. Also
version of the package can be retrieved.
[root]@[/] # apt-get -u install lilo

<p>
<prgn>dselect</prgn> is a program that helps users select Debian packages
but with practice you can get the hang of its console-based ncurses
interface.

One feature of dselect is that it knows how to make use of the capacity
Debian packages have for "recommending" and "suggesting" other packages
for installation.  To use the program, run <tt>`dselect'</tt> as root. 
you're not using a CD ROM and you want to download packages from the

<p>
People are sometimes interested in using one of the Debian
versions as its main system distribution and one or more packages
from another branch.
<p>
To set up what is your main version of Debian you should
edit the <file>/etc/apt/apt.conf</file> to contain the
<p>
<example>
APT::Default-Release "<var>version</var>";
</example>
<p>
Where <var>version</var> is the version of Debian you want to
use as the main distribution. The versions you can use are 
To install packages from another version, then, you must 
you APT in the following way:

<p>
<example>
# apt-get -t <var>distribution</var> install <var>package</var>
</example>
<p>
Finally, <tt>apt-get autoclean</tt> removes only the old files.
For that to work, though, you need at least one APT source line
in your <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> for the distribution
you want the package from, and the package must exist on that
source.
<p>
You can also request a specific version of a package using the
following sintax:

<example>
# apt-get install <var>package</var>=<var>version</var>
</example>

For example, the line below will install version <tt>2.2.4-1</tt>
of the <package>nautilus</package> package.:

<example>
# apt-get install nautilus=2.2.4-1
</example>

<em>IMPORTANT</em>: the `unstable' version of Debian is the version to
which the newest versions of Debian packages are uploaded first.  This
distribution sees all of the changes that packages go through, both
small ones and more drastic ones which affect many packages or the whole

<sect id="apt-show-versions">How to upgrade packages from specific versions of Debian
[root]@[/] # apt-get -u dselect-upgrade
<prgn>apt-show-versions</prgn> provides a safe way for users of mixed
distributions to upgrade their systems without getting more of the
less-stable distribution than they had in mind.  For instance, it is
possible to upgrade just your unstable packages by running after
having installed the <package>apt-show-versions</package> package:

<example>
# apt-get install `apt-show-versions -u -b | grep unstable | cut -d ' ' -f 1`

<sect id="pin">How to keep specific versions of packages installed (complex)
<p>
You may have occasion to modify something in a package and don't have
time or don't want to port those changes to a new version of the
program.  Or, for instance, you may have just upgraded your Debian
distribution to 3.0, but want to continue with the version of a certain
so that it will not be upgraded.
<p>
Using this resource is simple.  You just need to edit the file
<p>
[root]@[/] # apt-get -u dist-upgrade   
<p>
<example>
Package: &lt;package&gt;
Pin: &lt;pin definition&gt;
Pin-Priority: &lt;pin's priority&gt;
</example>
<p>
For example, to keep package <package>sylpheed</package> that I
have modified to use "reply-to-list" at version 0.4.99, I add:
<p>
Package: sylpheed
Pin: version 0.4.99*
</example>
<p>
Note that I used an <tt>*</tt> (asterisk).  This is a "wildcard"; it say
that I want that this "pin" to be valid for all versions beginning with
0.4.99.  This is because Debian versions its packages with a "Debian
revision" and I don't want to avoid the installation of these revisions.
So, for instance, versions 0.4.99-1 and 0.4.99-10 will be installed as
People often use the testing distribution because it is more stable
than unstable and more up-to-date than stable.  However, users who
would like to run the latest versions of some packages but still
rather not trust their entire systems to unstable also have the option
of running mixed testing/unstable systems.  On the flip side, more
conservative users may wish to run mixed stable/testing systems.
priorities, but a few examples should give the basic idea.  The following
To do that, put the following line on  <file>/etc/apt/apt.conf</file>:
package with a higher version.  Only packages of priority greater than
</item>
APT::Default-Release "testing";
<item>

The effect is the same as priority 1001, except that apt will refuse
Then, when going to install packages from unstable, just use the
<tt>-t</tt> switch:
to downgrade an installed version to 0.4.99
<tag>500</tag>
# apt-get -t unstable install <var>packagename</var>
preference over version 0.4.99, as will any installed higher version
of slypheed; so 0.4.99 will be installed only if no version is
installed already. This is the priority of installed packages.
Do not forget that to use packages from a version
of Debian, one needs to add an apt source line to the
<file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> file. In our
example's case, we need source lines for the
<tt>unstable</tt> distribution besides the
<tt>testing</tt> ones.

Pinning on a <tt>version</tt>, as we have seen, supports literal
version numbers as well as wildcards to specify several
versions at one time.

<p>
The format is simple:
<p>
<example>
The <tt>Priority</tt> field is optional; if not specified, it
defaults to 989.
<p>
Let's take a look at how pin priorities work.  A priority lower than 0
indicates that the package should never be installed.  Priorities 0 to
100 denote packages that are not installed and that have no available
versions.  These won't come into the version-choosing process.  Priority
100 is the priority assigned to an installed package - for the installed
version of a package to be replaced by a different version, the
replacement must have a priority greater than 100.
<p>
Priorities above 100 indicate that a package should be installed.
Typically, the installed version of a package is changed only to upgrade
it to a newer version.  Any priority between 100 and 1000 (inclusive)
indicates this typical behavior.  A package with such a priority will
not downgrade to an available version with a lower version number.  For
instance, if I have sylpheed 0.5.3 installed and define a pin on
sylpheed 0.4.99 with priority 999, package 0.4.99 will <em>not</em> be
installed to satisfy the pin.  To make a package "downgradable", to
satisfy the pin, it needs possess a priority greater than 1000.

release will take preference over version 0.4.99, but 0.4.99 will
still be preferred to a lower version.
</item>
<tag>100</tag>
<item>
Higher versions of sylpheed available from any release will take

<p>
Sometimes, people want to use a specific version of a program

packaging system can be a trouble when doing this. Suppose
you want to compile a new version of your email server. All
is fine, but many packages in Debian depend on an MTA (Mail

<p>
That's where <package>equivs</package> enters the scene. To use it,

<p>
Before we begin, it is good to remind you that there are safer
with different options, and that one should not use equivs to
replace dependencies if you don't know what you are doing.
Priority: optional
<p>
Let's continue with the MTA example, you just installed your
new compiled <prgn>postfix</prgn> and goes on for installing
<package>mutt</package>. Suddenly you discover that
<package>mutt</package> wants to install another MTA. But you
already have yours.

<p>
Yes, that's all. <package>mutt</package> depends on
<package>mail-transport-agent</package>, that is a virtual
package provided by all MTAs, I could simply name
the package <package>mail-transport-agent</package>, but I preferred
to use the virtual package's schema, using Provides.

dh_installdeb
dh_gencontrol

The package has been created.
Attention, the package has been created in the current directory,

And install the resulting <tt>.deb</tt>.
<p>
As one can see, there are several uses for <prgn>equivs</prgn>. One
can even crate a <tt>my-favorites</tt> package, which depends on
the programs you usually installs, for example. Just free your imagination,
but be careful.

There are some front-end programs for the APT system that make it
significantly easier to get listings of packages that are available
for installation or are already installed, as well as to find out what
section a package is in, what its priority is, what its description is, etc.
<p>
But... our goal here is to learn how to use pure APT.  So how can you find
out the name of a package that you want to install?
<p>
We have a number of resources for such a task.  We'll begin with
its database.  We'll take just a brief look at some of its more practical
applications.

stella - Atari 2600 Emulator for X windows
</example>

<p>
We find several packages related to what we're looking for, together with
brief descriptions.  To get more information about a specific package, I can
then use:

In this output you have many details about the package that you want (or
don't want) to install, together with the full description of the package.

One of the ways to locate the name of a package is to know the name of an

To find out the names of packages installed on your system, which is useful,

<example>
# dpkg -l | grep mozilla
ii  mozilla-browse 0.9.6-7        Mozilla Web Browser
</example>
<p>
The problem with this command is that it can "break" the package name.  In
the example above, the full name of the package is <tt>mozilla-browser</tt>.
To fix this, you can use the <tt>COLUMNS</tt> environment variable this way:

<p>
<example>
[kov]@[couve] $ COLUMNS=132 dpkg -l | grep mozilla
ii  mozilla-browser             0.9.6-7                     Mozilla Web Browser - core and browser

auto-apt run ./configure
<p>
You're compiling a program and, all of a sudden, boom!  There's an error
<prgn>auto-apt</prgn> can save you from such scenarios.  It asks you to
install packages if they're needed, stopping the relevant process and
continuing once the package is installed.
<p>
What you do, basically, is run:

<p>
<example>
# auto-apt run command
</example>

<p>
Where `command' is the command to be executed that may need some
unavailable file.  For example:

<p>
<example>
# auto-apt run ./configure

<p>
It will then ask to install the needed packages and call apt-get
automatically.  If you're running X, a graphical interface will

<sect id="apt-file">How to discover to which package a file belongs
If you want to install a package, and you can't find out what it is
called by searching with <prgn>apt-cache</prgn>, but know the filename 
of the program itself, or some other filename that belongs to the package,
then you can use <prgn>apt-file</prgn> to find the package name. This 

<p>
<example>
$ apt-file search <var>filename</var>

<p>
It works just like <tt>dpkg -S</tt>, but will also show you uninstalled
packages that contain the file. It could also be used to find what
compiling programs, although <prgn>auto-apt</prgn> is a much better 
method of solving such issues, see <ref id="auto-apt">.
<p>
You can also list the contents of a package, by running:

<p>
<example>
$ apt-file list <var>packagename</var>
</example>

<p>
<prgn>apt-file</prgn> keeps a database of which files all packages 
contain, just like auto-apt does and it needs to be up-to-date. 
This is done by running:

installation, Debconf will configure it. Answer to the questions
as you want.
<p>
The option "Should apt-listchanges be automatically run by apt?" is very
useful cause it shows a list of changes made to each package that's being
installed by apt during an upgrade and lets you analyze them before
continuing. The option "Should apt-listchanges prompt for confirmation after 
displaying changes?" is useful because it asks you wether you want to continue
installation after reading the list of changes. If you say that you don't
want to continue apt-listchanges will return an error and apt will abort
installation.
Every package installs in its documentation directory (<tt>/usr/share/doc/packagename</tt>)
a file called <tt>changelog.Debian.gz</tt> which contains the list of changes
made to the package since the last version. You can read these files with
<tt>zless</tt>' help, for example, but it is something not so easy, after an
complete system upgrade, to start searching changelogs for every upgraded
package.
<p>
There's a way to automatize this task by means of a tool called
<prgn>apt-listchanges</prgn>. To begin with one needs to install
the <package>apt-listchanges</package> package. During the package
installation, Debconf will configure it. Some questions may not be
shown to you depending on the priority you set up Debconf to use.
Answer to the questions as you want.
<p>
The first question asks how you want the changes to be showed by
apt-listchanges. You can have them mailed to you, which is good for
automatic upgrades, or you can ask them in a pager
like <prgn>less</prgn>, so you can inspect the changes before
leting the upgrade continue. If you don't
want <prgn>apt-listchanges</prgn> running automaticaly during
upgrades you can answer <tt>none</tt>.
<p>
After apt-listchanges is installed, as soon as packages are downloaded
(or gotten from a CD or mounted disk) by apt it will show the lists
of changes made to those packages before installing them.

apt-get source packagename
even make corrections to buggy code.  To do this, you would need to
to obtain source code to the many programs contained in the
distribution, including all the files needed to create a .deb for the
program.
<p>
Another common use of Debian sources is to adapt a more recent version
of a program, from the unstable distribution, for example, for use with
the stable distribution.  Compiling a package against stable will
generate .debs with dependencies adjusted to match the packages
available in this distribution.
<p>
To accomplish this, the <tt>deb-src</tt> entry in your
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> should be pointed at unstable.  It should
also be enabled (uncommented).  See section <ref id="sources.list">.
To download a source package, you would use the following command:
apt-get -b source packagename
<p>
<example>
</example>
<p>
This will download three files:  a <tt>.orig.tar.gz</tt>, a

If you decide not to create the .deb at the time of the download, you
can create it later by running:

from within the directory that was created for the package after
downloading. To install the package built by the commands above
one must use the package manager directly, like this:

normal users, without needing special root powers.  The files are

<sect id="build-dep">Packages needed for compiling a source package
<p>
Normally, specific headers and shared libraries need to be present in
order for a source package to be compiled.  All source packages have a

source.

APT has a simple way of downloading these packages.  Just run
<tt>apt-get build-dep package</tt>, where `package' is the name of the

<p>
The packages that will be installed are the packages needed in order for
<package>gmc</package> to be built correctly.  It's important to note
that this command doesn't look for the source package of the program to
be compiled.  You will therefore need to run <tt>apt-get source</tt>
separately to get it.

<p>
If all you want is checking what packages are needed to build a
given package, there's a variant of the <tt>apt-cache show</tt>
command (see <ref id="search">, which will show, among other
packages.

# apt-cache showsrc <var>package</var>

<p>
Errors will always happen, many of them caused by users not paying
how to deal with them.
<p>
If you receive a message that looks like the one below when trying to
run <tt>apt-get install package</tt>...

<example>
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
W: Couldn't stat source package list 'http://people.debian.org unstable/ Packages' (/var/state/apt/lists/people.debian.org_%7ekov_debian_unstable_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these missing files
E: Couldn't find package penguineyes

<p>
you forgot to run <tt>apt-get update</tt> after your last change to the
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file.

If the error looked like:

<example>
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13 Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?

you don't have root permission, that is, you're running as a normal

two commands:

<p>
<example>
# apt-get -f install
# dpkg --configure -a
</example>

<p>
And then try again.  It may be necessary to run the second of the above
commands more than once.  This is an important lesson for those
adventurers who use `unstable'.

<p>
If you receive the error "E: Dynamic MMap ran out of room" when running
<tt>apt-get update</tt>, add the following line to 
<file>/etc/apt/apt.conf</file>:

<example>
APT::Cache-Limit 10000000;

If you find yourself plagued by doubts, consult the extensive
documentation available for the Debian packaging system.
<tt>--help</tt>'s and manpages can be an enormous help to you, as can
the documentation contained in the <tt>/usr/share/doc</tt> directories
such as <tt>/usr/share/doc/apt</tt>.

about specific user lists on the Debian website: <url

Remember that these lists and resources should be used only by Debian
users; users of other systems will find better support from the
