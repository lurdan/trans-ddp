	  You need to install apt-show-versions before using

	* (pt_BR, en)

	* (pt_BR, en)
	  Moved some text from the "install" section to the
	  "default-version" section, where it fits better.
	  Also clarify the specific version installation and
	  change some text that implied testing was better than
	  unstable. (Closes: #180534)

	* (all)
	  Changed the prompt symbol used on the examples
	  of the section about source packages to show
	  '$' instead of '#' where possible on all translations

	* (all)
	  Change 'Priority' to 'Pin-Priority' on all the
	  versions. (Closes: #195270)
