<title>Building a Custom Kernel for a Debian/Linux System
<author>Susan Kleinmann <email/sgk@debian.org/
<version>version &kernel-version;, <date>

<abstract>
This text tells users of a Debian system how to build a kernel customized
to their needs and/or hardware.  It exploits a tool available on Debian
systems called <prgn>make-kpkg</prgn>, as well as the Debian package
installer, <prgn>dpkg</prgn>.  Instructions are also provided for 
building a Debian kernel on an alien system.
