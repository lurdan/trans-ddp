<chapt id="intro">Introduction to Debian Kernel Building
<P>
<!-- Objectives of the document -->
The objectives of this document are to help users to build custom kernels 
using sources available at various anonymous FTP sites, and to show how
to boot a new or existing Debian system with that custom kernel.  

<P>
<!-- Where to get the latest version of this document -->
The latest version of this document can be obtained at

<!-- How this document was written (i.e., reference material or list of experts who were consulted -->
This document emerged from a collection of emails on the <tt>debian-devel</tt>
mailing list, along with sage advice from the maintainers of Debian
packages that are closely associated with building custom kernels.
The original text was written by Susan Kleinmann, but quickly over-written
by XXX, who knew what he was talking about.
