<chapt id="faqinfo">General information about the FAQ

<sect id="authors">Authors

<p>The first edition of this FAQ was made and maintained by J.H.M. Dassen
(Ray) and Chuck Stickelman. Authors of the rewritten &debian; FAQ are
Susan G. Kleinmann and Sven Rudolph. After them, the FAQ was maintained
by Santiago Vila and, later, by Josip Rodin.
The current maintainer is Javier Fernandez-Sanguino.

<p>Parts of the information came from:
<list>
  <item>The Debian-1.1 release announcement, by <url name="Bruce Perens" id="http://www.perens.com/">.
  <item>The Linux FAQ, by <url name="Ian Jackson" id="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ijackson/">.
  <item><url name="Debian Mailing Lists Archives" id="http://lists.debian.org/">,
  <item>the dpkg programmers' manual and the Debian Policy manual
    (see <ref id="debiandocs">)
  <item>many developers, volunteers, and beta testers, and
  <item>the flaky memories of its authors. :-)
  <item>Kamaraju Kusumanchi's <url name="Choosing a Debian distribution FAQ" id="http://people.cornell.edu/pages/kk288/debian_choosing_distribution.html">, who graciously made it GPL so I could include it as a new chapter (see <ref id="choosing">)
