Description: The Debian FAQ
 In this package you will find the Debian GNU/Linux FAQ, which gives
 frequently asked questions (with their answers!) about the Debian distribution
 (Debian GNU/Linux and others) and about the Debian project.
 Some answers assume some knowledge of Unix-like operating systems.
 However, as little prior knowledge as possible is assumed: answers to general
 beginners questions will be kept simple.
