debian-faq (4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Debian FAQ is now maintained using SVN (no longer using CVS.)
  [ Changes by Joost van Baal ]
  * The Debian FAQ's debian/ packaging stuff is now maintained using a
    revision control system: SVN on Alioth.
    - debian/control:  Add Vcs-* headers.
  * This package no longer is called doc-debian, but debian-faq; it contains
    the Debian GNU/Linux FAQ only.  See doc-debian's debian/changelog for
    the history of the Debian GNU/Linux FAQ. (Closes: #473998)
    - debian/rules: remove stuff referring to constitution or social-contract.
    - debian/{prerm,postinst}: remove stuff referring to reporting-bugs,
      manifesto, mailing-lists or social-contract.
    - debian/control: package is now called debian-faq, not doc-debian.  Rewrote
      package description.  Add Conflicts: doc-debian <= 3.1.5.
    - debian/copyright: remove license conditions of non-FAQ documents.
  * debian/control: add Homepage header.
  * debian/control: add myself to Uploaders, after ack from jfs.
  * debian/rules: faq no longer is in FAQ/, but in .: adjust build rules.
  * debian/doc-base: imported from doc-debian-3.1.5/doc-base/debian-faq.
    updated list of authors.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version from 3.6.2.0 to 3.7.3 (no changes
    needed.)
  * Create new binary Debian packages debian-faq-de, debian-faq-fr,
    debian-faq-it, debian-faq-zh-cn for translations which are somewhat up to
    date and not yet available as Debian packages.  Use debhelper's dh_install
    to deal with these multiple packages: we now build-depend upon debhelper.
    When at it, use dh_installdeb, dh_gencontrol, dh_md5sums and dh_builddeb
    too.
    - debian/{rules,control}: install de, fr, it and zh_CN translations too.
    - debian/compat: enforce debhelper compatibility level 5.
    - debian/rules: build needed languages (de, fr, it and zh_CN) only.
    - debian/debian-faq-{de,fr,it,zh-cn}.{dirs,install}: add debhelper files
      for building extra binary packages.
    - debian/rules: use debhelper's dh_installchangelog, dh_installdocs and
      dh_compress to handle debian/{copyright,changelog} and doc-base stuff.
      add needed dh_clean calls.
    - debian/rules: replace handcrafted chmod/chown call with dh_fixperms.
    - debian/debian-faq*.doc-base, debian/debian-faq*.{prerm,postrm}: add
      doc-base registrations for all packages, let debhelper deal with them.
  * Update the content of the FAQ files to their latest SVN

          Macromedia/Adobe's non-free player); VoIP (don't mention non-free
          Skype); mention ndiswrapper; mention Google Earth (or is that not
          suitable for this faq?)

          that djb is placing his software into the public domain.

          I get the Debian installation disks?".  Removed it.
        * getting.sgml: we do DVDs too, not just CDs
        * getting.sgml: Given the current size of Debian, installing from
          floppy is next to impossible. Therefore, remove section "Can I
          install it from a pile of floppy disks?"
        * getting.sgml: http://www.debian.org/CD is more up to date on
          getting CD images than this faq: add referral
        * pkg_basics.sgml: Mention wrapper tools for building .deb from
          source package. Thanks Tim Richardson for his suggestion in
          <1203086175.11942.24.camel@d420>.

          details to end of chapter
        * uptodate.sgml: dselect built in access methods (like dpkg-ftp)
          are obsolete: remove section
        * software.sgml: non-us is obsolete since sarge: remove section
        * getting.sgml: dselect's build-in access methods are obsolete. Do
          not talk about low level cd image details like Rock Ridge
          extensions: that's not suitable for newbies.
        * pkgtools.sgml: fix bug in description of "apt-get dist-upgrade".
          explain difference with "apt-get upgrade"
     - changes by joostvb, 2007-09-21
        * pkg_basics.sgml: Files containing Debian packages typically have
          a component representing the Debian architecture in their name.
          Thanks Justin Pryzby. (Closes: #443472)
     - changes by joostvb, 2007-07-11
        * basic_defs.sgml: Michael K. Johnson's INFO-SHEET and META-FAQ have
          been unmaintained for a very long time. Refer to Linux Online instead.
        * basic_defs.sgml: We don't release every several months, but at
          about every 2 years (checked potato - woody - sarge - etch ( - lenny)
          release dates).  FTP archives are update twice, not once a day.
        * basic_defs.sgml: when asked what debian is, first tell about the
          nice things. explain the boring stuff like what a distribution is
          later: swapped 2 sections
        * support.sgml: remove notes about sections of manpages: too much
          techical detail for intented audience. give example "man ls"
          instead and refer to man(1)
        * support.sgml: mention yelp too, as an alternative for dwww,
          doc-central e.a.
