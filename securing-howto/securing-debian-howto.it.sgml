<!--
# TODO list:
# - There was a 'useful software section' why was it removed? 
# - Shorten overlong lines - there are lots of sections (by jfs?) where
#   lines are routinely longer than 80 characters. Actually it makes sense
#   to author SGML with much shorter lines, because it makes editing simpler
#   (while the internal line length of the SGML source is obviously not
#   visible in any way to the end user).
#   (occur (make-string 80 ?.))   ;  C-x C-e here
# - Remove gratuitous trailing whitespace; M-x occur " +$"
# - Consider changing order of subsections so as to match the order in
#   the checklist appendix
