<chapt>After Installation

<p>Once the system is installed you can still do more to secure the system;
some of the steps described in this chapter can be taken. Of course
this really depends on your setup but for physical access prevention
you should read <ref id="bios-boot">,<ref id="lilo-passwd">,<ref
id="kernel-root-prompt">, <ref id="floppy-boot">, <ref
id="restrict-console-login">, and <ref id="restrict-reboots">.

<p>Before connecting to any network, especially if it's a public one
you should, at the very least, execute a security update (see 
<ref id="security-update">). Optionally, you could take a snapshot of your
system (see <ref id="snapshot">).

<sect id="debian-sec-announce">Subscribe to the Debian Security Announce mailing List

<p>In order to receive information on available security updates you
should subscribe yourself to the debian-security-announce mailing list
in order to receive the Debian Security Advisories (DSAs). See <ref
id="debian-sec-team"> for more information on how the Debian security
team works. For information on how to subscribe to the Debian mailing
lists read <url id="http://lists.debian.org">.

<p>DSAs are signed with the Debian Security Team's signature which can
be retrieved from <url id="http://security.debian.org">.

<p>You should consider, also, subscribing to the <url
id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security" name="debian-security
mailing list"> for general discussion on security issues in the Debian
operating system. You will be able to contact other fellow system
administrators in the list as well as Debian developers and upstream
developers of security tools who can answer your questions and offer
advice.

<p>FIXME: add the key here too?

<sect id="security-update">Execute a security update

<p>As soon as new security bugs are detected in packages, Debian
maintainers and upstream authors generally patch them within days or
even hours. After the bug is fixed, a new package is provided on <url
name="http://security.debian.org" id="http://security.debian.org">.

<p>If you are installing a Debian release you must take into account
that since the release was made there might have been security updates
after it has been determined that a given package is vulnerable. Also,
there might have been minor releases (there were seven in Debian
2.2 <em>potato</em> release) which include these package updates. 

<p>You need to note down the date the removable media (if you are
using it) was made and check the security site in order to see if
there are security updates. If there are and you cannot download the
packages from the security site on another system (you are not
connected to the Internet yet? are you?) before connecting to the
network you could consider (if not protected by a firewall for
example) adding firewall rules so that your system could only connect
to security.debian.org and then run the update. A sample configuration
is shown in <ref id="fw-security-update">.

<p><em>Note:</em>Since Debian woody 3.0, after installation you are given the
opportunity to add security updates to the system. If you say 'yes' to this,
the installation system will take the appropiate steps to add the
source for security updates to your package sources and your system, if
you have an Internet connection, will download and install any security
updates that might have been produced after your media was created.
If you are upgrading a previous version of Debian, or you asked 
the installation system not to do this, you should take the steps 
described here.

<p>To manually update the system, put the following line in your
<file>sources.list</file> and you will get security updates
automatically, whenever you update your system.

<example>
  deb http://security.debian.org/ stable/updates main contrib non-free
</example>

<p>Once you've done this you can either use <package>apt</package> or
<package>dselect</package> to upgrade:

<list>
<item>If you want to use <package>apt</package> just do (as root):
<example>
# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade
</example>
<item>If you want to use <package>dselect</package> then first [U]pdate,
then [I]nstall and finally, [C]onfigure the installed/upgraded packages.
</list>

<p>If you like, you can add the deb-src lines to 
<file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> as well. See 
<manref name="apt" section="8"> for further details.

<p>Note: You do <em>not</em> need to add the following line:

<example>
  deb http://security.debian.org/debian-non-US stable/non-US main contrib non-free
</example>
<p>this is because security.debian.org is is hosted in a non-US location and 
doesn't have a seperate non-US archive.

<sect id="bios-boot">Change the BIOS (again)

<p>Remember <ref id="bios-passwd">? Well, then you should now, once
you do not need to boot from removable media, to change the default
BIOS setup so that it <em>only</em> boots from the hard drive. Make
sure you will not lose the BIOS password, otherwise, in the event of a
hard disk failure you will not be able to return to the BIOS and
change the setup so you can recover it using, for example, a CD-ROM.

<p>Another less secure but more convenient way is to change the
setup to have the system boot up from the hard disk and, if it fails,
try removable media. By the way, this is often done because
most people don't use the BIOS password that often; it's easily forgotten.

<sect id="lilo-passwd">Set a LILO or GRUB password
<p>
Anybody can easily get a root-shell and change your passwords by
entering <tt>&lt;name-of-your-bootimage&gt; init=/bin/sh</tt> at the boot
prompt. After changing the passwords and rebooting the system, the
person has unlimited root-access and can do anything he/she wants to the
system.  After this procedure you will not have root access to your
system, as you do not know the root password.
<p>
To make sure that this cannot happen, you should set a password for
the boot loader. You can choose between a global password or a
password for a certain image.
<p>
For LILO you need to edit the config file <file>/etc/lilo.conf</file> and add a
<tt>password</tt> and <tt>restricted</tt> line as in the example below.

<example>
  image=/boot/2.2.14-vmlinuz
     label=Linux
     read-only
     password=hackme
     restricted
</example>

<p>
When done, rerun lilo.  Omitting the <tt>restricted</tt> line causes lilo to
always prompt for a password, regardless of whether LILO was passed
parameters. The default permissions for <file>/etc/lilo.conf</file>
grant read and write permissions to root, and enable read-only access
for <file>lilo.conf</file>'s group, root.

<p>
If you use GRUB instead of LILO, edit <file>/boot/grub/menu.lst</file>
and add the following two lines at the top (substituting, of course
<tt>hackme</tt> with the desired password). This prevents users from editing
the boot items. <tt>timeout 3</tt> specifies a 3 second delay before 
<prgn>grub</prgn> boots the default item.

<example>
  timeout 3
  password hackme
</example>

<p>To further harden the integrity of the password, you may store the password
in an encrypted form. The utility <prgn>grub-md5-crypt</prgn> generates a 
hashed password which is compatible with grub's encrypted password algorithm 
(md5).
To specify in <prgn>grub</prgn> that an md5 format password will be used, use 
the following directive:
<example>
  timeout 3
  password --md5 $1$bw0ez$tljnxxKLfMzmnDVaQWgjP0
</example>

The --md5 parameter was added to instruct <prgn>grub</prgn> to perform the md5 
authentication process. The provided password is the md5 encrypted version of 
hackme. Using the md5 password method is preferable to choosing its cleartext 
counterpart. More information about <prgn>grub</prgn> passwords may be found 
in the <package>grub-doc</package> package.

<sect id="kernel-root-prompt">Remove root prompt on the kernel

<p>Linux 2.4 kernels provide a way to access a root shell while booting which 
will be presented just after loading the cramfs file system. A message will 
appear to permit the administrator to enter an executable shell with root 
permissions, this shell can be used to manually load modules when 
autodetection fails. This behavior is the default for <prgn>initrd</prgn>'s 
<file>linuxrc</file>. The following message will appear:
<example>
  Press ENTER to obtain a shell (waits 5 seconds)
</example>

<p>In order to remove this behavior you need to change 
<file>/etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd.conf</file> and set:
<example>
  # DELAY  The  number  of seconds the linuxrc script should wait to
  # allow the user to interrupt it before the system is brought up
  DELAY=0
</example>
<p>Then regenerate your ramdisk image. You can do this for example with:
<example>
  # cd /boot
  # mkinitrd -o initrd.img-2.4.18-k7 /lib/modules/2.4.18-k7
</example>
<p>or (preferred):
<example>
  # dpkg-reconfigure -plow kernel-image-2.4.x-yz
</example>
<p>Note that Debian 3.0 woody allows users to install 2.4 kernels
(selecting <em>flavors</em>), <em>however</em> the default kernel
is 2.2 (save for some architectures for which kernel 2.2 was not
ported). If you consider this a bug consider
<url id="http://bugs.debian.org/145244" name="Bug 145244"> before sending it.

<sect id="floppy-boot">Disallow floppy booting
<p>
The default MBR in Debian before version 2.2 did not act as a usual
master boot record and left open a method to easily break into a
system:

<list>
<item>Press shift at boot time, and an MBR prompt appears 

<item>Then press F, and your system will boot from floppy disk. This
can be used to get root access to the system.
</list>

<p>This behavior can be changed by entering:

<example>
  lilo -b /dev/hda
</example>

<p>Now LILO is put into the MBR. This can also be achieved by adding
<tt>boot=/dev/hda</tt> to <file>lilo.conf</file>. There is another 
solution which will disable the MBR prompt completely:

<example>
  install-mbr -i n /dev/hda
</example>

<p>On the other hand, this "back door", of which many people are just not
aware, may save your skin as well if you run into deep trouble with your
installation for whatever reasons.

<p>FIXME check whether this really is true as of 2.2 or was it 2.1?
INFO: The bootdisks as of Debian 2.2 do NOT install the mbr, but only LILO.


<sect id="restrict-console-login">Restricting console login access 

<p>Some security policies might force administrators to log in to
the system through the console with their user/password and then
become superuser (with <prgn>su</prgn> or <prgn>sudo</prgn>). This
policy is implemented in Debian by editing the
<file>/etc/login.defs</file> file or <file>/etc/securetty</file> when
using PAM. In:

<list>

<item><file>login.defs</file>, editing the CONSOLE variable which
defines a file or list of terminals on which root logins are allowed

<item><file>securetty</file> 
<footnote>
The <file>/etc/securetty</file> is a configuration file that belongs
to the <package>login</package> package.
</footnote>
by adding/removing the terminals to which
root access will be allowed. If you wish to allow only local console access
then you need <em>console</em>,<em>ttyX</em> 
<footnote>
Or <em>ttyvX</em> in GNU/FreeBSD, and <em>ttyE0</em> in GNU/KNetBSD.
</footnote>
and <em>vc/X</em> (if using <em>devfs</em> devices), you might want to add
also <em>ttySX</em> 
<footnote>
Or <em>comX</em> in GNU/Hurd, <em>cuaaX</em> in GNU/FreeBSD, 
and ttyXX in GNU/KNetBSD.
</footnote>
if you are using
a serial console for local access (where X is an integer, you might want
to have multiple instances
<footnote>
The default configuration in <em>woody</em> includes 12 
local tty and vc consoles, as well as the <em>console</em> device but
does not allow remote logins.  In <em>sarge</em> the default 
configuration provides 64 consoles for tty and vc consoles. 
You can safely remove this if you are not using that many consoles.
</footnote>
depending on the number of virtual consoles
you have enabled in <file>/etc/inittab</file>
<footnote>Look for the <em>getty</em> calls.</footnote>).For more
information on terminal devices read  he
<url id="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-6.html" name="Text-Terminal-HOWTO">

</list>

<p>When using PAM, other changes to the login process, which might
include restrictions to users and groups at given times, can be
configured in <file>/etc/pam.d/login</file>. An interesting feature
that can be disabled is the possibility to login with null (blank)
passwords. This feature can be limited by removing <em>nullok</em>
from the line:

<example>
  auth       required   pam_unix.so nullok
</example>

<sect id="restrict-reboots">Restricting system reboots through the console

<p>If your system has a keyboard attached to it anyone (yes
<em>anyone</em>) can reboot the system through it without login to the
system. This might, or might not, adhere to your security policy. If
you want to restrict this, you must check the
<file>/etc/inittab</file> so that the line that includes
<tt>ctrlaltdel</tt> calls <prgn>shutdown</prgn> with the <tt>-a</tt>
switch (remember to run <tt>init q</tt> after making any changes to
this file). The default in Debian includes this switch:

<example>
  ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now
</example>

<p>Now, in order to allow <em>some</em> users to shutdown the system,
as the manpage <manref section="8" name="shutdown"> describes, you must
create the file <file>/etc/shutdown.allow</file> and include there the
name of users which can boot the system. When the <em>three finger
salute</em> (a.k.a. <em>ctrl+alt+del</em>) is given the program will
check if any of the users listed in the file are logged in. If none of
them is, <prgn>shutdown</prgn> will <em>not</em> reboot the system.
 
</sect>

<sect>Mounting partitions the right way
<p>
When mounting an ext2 partition, there are several additional options
you can apply to the mount call or to <file>/etc/fstab</file>. For
instance, this is my fstab entry for the <file>/tmp</file> partition:

<example>
  /dev/hda7    /tmp    ext2    defaults,nosuid,noexec,nodev    0    2
</example>

<p>
You see the difference in the options sections. The option
<tt>nosuid</tt> ignores the setuid and setgid bits completely, while
<tt>noexec</tt> forbids execution of any program on that mount point,
and <tt>nodev</tt>, ignores devices. This sounds great, but it
<list>
<item>only applies to ext2 file systems
<item>can be circumvented easily
</list>

<p>The <tt>noexec</tt> option prevents binaries from being executed
directly, but is easily circumvented:

<example>
  alex@joker:/tmp# mount | grep tmp
  /dev/hda7 on /tmp type ext2 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
  alex@joker:/tmp# ./date
  bash: ./date: Permission denied
  alex@joker:/tmp# /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ./date
  Sun Dec  3 17:49:23 CET 2000
</example>

<p>However, many script kiddies have exploits which try to create and execute 
files in <file>/tmp</file>. If they do not have a clue, they will fall into
this pit. In other words, a user cannot be tricked into executing a trojanized 
binary in <file>/tmp</file> e.g. when he incidentally adds <file>/tmp</file> 
into his PATH.

<p>Also be forewarned, some script might depend on <file>/tmp</file> being
executable. Most notably, Debconf has (had?) some issues regarding
this, for more information see Bug <url
id="http://bugs.debian.org/116448" name="116448">.

<p>
The following is a more thorough example. A note, though: 
<file>/var</file> could be set noexec, but some software 
<footnote>Some of this includes the package manager <package>dpkg</package>
since the installation (post,pre) and removal (post,pre) scripts are
at <file>/var/lib/dpkg/</file> and Smartlist</footnote>
keeps its programs under in <file>/var</file>. 
The same applies to the nosuid option.

<example>
/dev/sda6       /usr            ext2    defaults,ro,nodev       0       2
/dev/sda12      /usr/share      ext2    defaults,ro,nodev,nosuid        0       2
/dev/sda7       /var            ext2    defaults,nodev,usrquota,grpquota          0       2
/dev/sda8       /tmp            ext2    defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec,usrquota,grpquota    0       2
/dev/sda9       /var/tmp        ext2    defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec,usrquota,grpquota    0       2
/dev/sda10      /var/log        ext2    defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec    0       2
/dev/sda11      /var/account    ext2    defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec    0       2
/dev/sda13      /home           ext2    rw,nosuid,nodev,exec,auto,nouser,async,usrquota,grpquota                0       2
/dev/fd0        /mnt/fd0        ext2    defaults,users,nodev,nosuid,noexec      0       0
/dev/fd0        /mnt/floppy     vfat    defaults,users,nodev,nosuid,noexec      0       0
/dev/hda        /mnt/cdrom      iso9660 ro,users,nodev,nosuid,noexec            0       0
</example>

<sect1>Setting <file>/tmp</file> noexec
<p>Be careful if setting <file>/tmp</file> noexec when you want to install new 
software, since some programs might use it for installation. 
<package>Apt</package> is one such program (see 
<url id="http://bugs.debian.org/116448">) if not configured properly
<tt>APT::ExtractTemplates::TempDir</tt> (see 
<manref name="apt-extracttemplates" section="1">). 
You can set this variable in <file>/etc/apt/apt.conf</file> to another 
directory with exec privileges other than <file>/tmp</file>.

<!-- This is a duplicate of the example a few paragraphs up -->
<p>Regarding noexec, please be aware that it might not offer you that much 
security. 
Consider this:
<example>
  $ cp /bin/date /tmp
  $ /tmp/date
  (does not execute due to noexec)
  $/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /tmp/date
  (works since date is not executed directly)
</example>

<sect1>Setting /usr read-only
<p>If you set <file>/usr</file> read-only you will not be able to install new 
packages on your Debian GNU/Linux system. You will have to first remount it 
read-write, install the packages and then remount it read-only. The latest 
<package>apt</package> version (in Debian 3.0 'woody') can be configured to 
run commands before and after installing packages, so you might want to 
configure it properly.

<p>To do this modify <file>/etc/apt/apt.conf</file> and add:
<example>
  DPkg
  {
      Pre-Invoke  { "mount /usr -o remount,rw" };
      Post-Invoke { "mount /usr -o remount,ro" };
  };
</example>

<p>Note that the Post-Invoke may fail with a "/usr busy" error message.
This happens mainly when you are using files during the update that
got updated.  Annoying but not really a big deal.  Just make sure
these are no longer used and run the Post-Invoke manually.

<sect>Providing secure user access

<sect1 id="auth-pam">User authentication: PAM

<p>PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) allows system administrators
to choose how applications authenticate users. Note that PAM can do
nothing unless an application is compiled with support for PAM. Most
of the applications that are shipped with Debian 2.2 have this support
built in. Furthermore, Debian did not have PAM support before 2.2. The
current default configuration for any PAM-enabled service is to
emulate UNIX authentication (read
<file>/usr/share/doc/libpam0g/Debian-PAM-MiniPolicy.gz</file> for more
information on how PAM services <em>should</em> work in Debian).


<p>Each application with PAM support provides a configuration file
in <file>/etc/pam.d/</file> which can be used to modify its behavior:

<list>
<item>what backend is used for authentication.
<item>what backend is used for sessions.
<item>how do password checks behave.
</list>

<p>
The following description is far from complete, for more information
you might want to read the <url
id="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/Linux-PAM-html/pam.html"
name="The Linux-PAM System Administrator's Guide"> (at the <url
id="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/" name="primary PAM
distribution site">), this document is also provided in the
<package>libpam-doc</package>.

<p>PAM offers you the possibility to go through several authentication steps at
once, without the user's knowledge. You could authenticate against a Berkeley
database and against the normal <file>passwd</file> file,
and the user only logs in if he authenticates correct in both.
You can restrict a lot with PAM, just as you can open your system
doors very wide. So be careful. A typical configuration line has a control
field as its second element. 
<!-- Second in mine (old Debian v2.0 though), check this! (FIXME) (era) -->
Generally it should be set to <tt>requisite</tt>, which
returns a login failure if one module fails.
<!-- Lots of fields in mine are "required", please elaborate? (FIXME) (era) -->

<p>The first thing I like to do, is to add MD5 support to PAM 
applications, since this helps protect against dictionary cracks (passwords 
can be longer if using MD5). The following two lines should be added to all 
files in <file>/etc/pam.d/</file> that grant access to the machine, like 
<tt>login</tt> and <tt>ssh</tt>.

<example>
  # Be sure to install libpam-cracklib first or you will not be able to log in
  password   required     pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=12 difok=3
  password   required     pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5
</example>


<p>So, what does this incantation do? The first line loads the
cracklib PAM module, which provides password strength-checking,
prompts for a new password with a minimum length of 12 characters, a
difference of at least 3 characters from the old password, and allows
3 retries. The second line introduces the standard authentication
module with MD5 passwords and allows a zero length password.  The
<tt>use_authtok</tt> directive is necessary to hand over the password from the
previous module. The package depends in a wordlist (such as
<package>wenglish</package>, <package>wspanish</package>, 
<package>wbritish</package>...), make sure that you install the one 
appropiate to your language (otherwise it might not be useful at all).
<footnote>
This dependancy is not fixed, however, in the Debian 3.0 package. Please
see <url id="http://bugs.debian.org/112965" name="Bug #112965">.
</footnote>

<p>To make sure that the user root can only log into the system from
local terminals, the following line should be enabled in
<file>/etc/pam.d/login</file>:

<example>
  auth     requisite  pam_securetty.so
</example>

<p>Then you should add the terminals from which the user root can log
into the system, in <file>/etc/security/access.conf</file>.  Last but not
least the following line should be enabled if you want to set up user
limits.

<!-- FIXME: This is pam.d/login you're talking about, still? Elaborate? era -->
<example>
  session  required   pam_limits.so
</example>

<p>This restricts the system resources that users are allowed (see
below in <ref id="user-limits"> ).  For example, you could restrict the
number of concurrent logins (of a given group of users, or
system-wide) you may have, the number of processes, the memory size...

<p>Now edit <file>/etc/pam.d/passwd</file> and change the first line. You
should add the option "md5" to use MD5 passwords, change the minimum
length of password from 4 to 6 (or more) and set a maximum length, if
you desire. The resulting line will look something like:

<example>
  password   required   pam_unix.so nullok obscure min=6 max=11 md5
</example>

<p>If you want to protect su, so that only some people can use it to
become root on your system, you need to add a new group "wheel" to your
system (that is the cleanest way, since no file has such a group
permission yet). Add root and the other users that should be able to
<prgn>su</prgn> to the root user to this group.  Then add the following line to
<file>/etc/pam.d/su</file>:

<example>
  auth        requisite   pam_wheel.so group=wheel debug
</example>

<p>This makes sure that only people from the group "wheel" can use
<prgn>su</prgn> to become root. Other users will not be able to become
root. In fact they will get a denied message if they try to become
root.

<p>If you want only certain users to authenticate at a PAM service,
this is quite easy to achieve by using files where the users who are
allowed to login (or not) are stored. Imagine you only want to allow
user 'ref' to log in via <prgn>ssh</prgn>. So you put him into
<file>/etc/sshusers-allowed</file> and write the following into
<file>/etc/pam.d/ssh</file>:

<example>
  auth        required    pam_listfile.so item=user sense=allow file=/etc/sshusers-allowed onerr=fail
</example>

<p>Last, but not least, create <file>/etc/pam.d/other</file> and enter
the following lines:

<example>
  auth     required       pam_securetty.so
  auth     required       pam_unix_auth.so
  auth     required       pam_warn.so
  auth     required       pam_deny.so
  account  required       pam_unix_acct.so
  account  required       pam_warn.so
  account  required       pam_deny.so
  password required       pam_unix_passwd.so
  password required       pam_warn.so
  password required       pam_deny.so
  session  required       pam_unix_session.so
  session  required       pam_warn.so
  session  required       pam_deny.so
</example>

<p>These lines will provide a good default configuration for all
applications that support PAM (access is denied by default).


<sect1 id="user-limits">Limiting resource usage: the <file>limits.conf</file> file

<p>
You should really take a serious look into this file. Here you can
define user resource limits. If you use PAM, the file
<file>/etc/limits.conf</file> is ignored and you should use
<file>/etc/security/limits.conf</file> instead.

<p>If you do not restrict resource usage, <em>any</em> user with a
valid shell in your system (or even an intruder who compromised the
system through a service) can use up as much CPU, memory, stack,
etc. as the system can provide. This <em>resource exhaustion</em>
problem can only be fixed by the use of PAM. Note that there is a way
to add resource limits to some shells (for example, <prgn>bash</prgn> has
<prgn>ulimit</prgn>, see <manref section="1" name="bash">), but since not
all of them provide the same limits and since the user can change
shells (see <manref section="1" name="chsh">) it is better to place
the limits on the PAM modules.

<sect1>User Login actions: edit <file>/etc/login.defs</file>
<p>
The next step is to edit the basic configuration and action upon user login.

<example>
  FAIL_DELAY          10
</example>

<p>This variable should be set to a higher value to make it harder to
use the terminal to log in using brute force. If a wrong password is
typed in, the possible attacker (or normal user!) has to wait for 10
seconds to get a new login prompt, which is quite time consuming when
you test passwords (manually). Pay attention to the fact that this
setting is useless if using a program other than <prgn>getty</prgn>, 
such as <prgn>mingetty</prgn> for example.

<example>
  FAILLOG_ENAB        yes
</example>

If you enable this variable, failed logins will be logged. It is important to
keep track of them to catch someone who tries a brute force attack.

<example>
  LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB    yes
</example>

<p>If you set the variable <var>FAILLOG_ENAB</var> to yes, then you should also
set this variable to yes. This will record unknown usernames if the
login failed. If you do this, make sure the logs have the proper
permissions (640 for example, with an appropriate group setting such
as adm), because users often accidentally enter their password as the
username and you do not want others to see it.

<example>
  SYSLOG_SU_ENAB      yes
</example>

<p>This one enables logging of <prgn>su</prgn> attempts to <file>syslog</file>. Quite
important on serious machines but note that this can create privacy
issues as well.

<example>
  SYSLOG_SG_ENAB      yes
</example>

<p>The same as <var>SYSLOG_SU_ENAB</var> but applies to the <prgn>sg</prgn> 
program.

<example>
  MD5_CRYPT_ENAB      yes
</example>

<p>As stated above, MD5 sum passwords greatly reduce the problem of
dictionary attacks, since you can use longer passwords.
If you are using slink, read the docs about MD5 before enabling this
option.  Otherwise this is set in PAM.

<example>
  PASS_MAX_LEN        50
</example>

<p>If MD5 passwords are activated in your PAM configuration, then this
variable should be set to the same value as used there.


<sect1>Restricting ftp: editing <file>/etc/ftpusers</file>
<p>
The <file>/etc/ftpusers</file> file contains a list of users who are
not allowed to log into the host using ftp. Only use this file if you
really want to allow ftp (which is not recommended in general, because
it uses cleartext passwords). If your daemon supports PAM, you can
also use that to allow and deny users for certain services.

<p>FIXME (BUG): Is it a bug that the default <file>ftpusers</file> in Debian 
does <em>not</em> include all the administrative users (in 
<package>base-passwd</package>).

<sect1>Using su

<p>
If you really need users to become the super user on your system, e.g. for 
installing packages or adding users, you can use the command <prgn>su</prgn> 
to change your identity. You should try to avoid any login as user root and 
instead use <prgn>su</prgn>.  Actually, the best solution is to remove 
<prgn>su</prgn> and switch to <prgn>sudo</prgn>, as it has more features than 
<prgn>su</prgn>. However, <prgn>su</prgn> is more common as it is used on many 
other Unices.


<sect1>Using sudo

<p>
<prgn>sudo</prgn> allows the user to execute defined commands under
another user's identity, even as root. If the user is added to
<file>/etc/sudoers</file> and authenticates himself correctly, he is
able to run commands which have been defined in
<file>/etc/sudoers</file>. Violations, such as incorrect passwords or
trying to run a program you don't have permission for, are logged and
mailed to root.

<sect1>Disallow remote adminitrative access
<p>You should modify <file>/etc/security/access.conf</file> also so
that remote administrative login is disallowed. This way the users
need to use <prgn>su</prgn> (or <prgn>sudo</prgn>) so that there is
always an audit trace whenever a local user wants to use
administrative powers. 

<p>You need to add the following line to
<file>/etc/security/access.conf</file>, the default Debian
configuration file has a sample line commented out:
<example>
   -:wheel:ALL EXCEPT LOCAL
</example>


<sect1 id="user-restrict">Restricting users's access

<p>Sometimes you might think you need to have users created in your
local system in order to provide a given service (pop3 mail service or
ftp). Before doing so, first remember that the PAM implementation in
Debian GNU/Linux allows you to validate users with a wide variety of
external directory services (radius, ldap, etc.) provided by the
libpam packages.

<p>If users need to be created and the system can be accessed remotely
take into account that users will be able to log in to the system. You
can fix this by giving users a null (<file>/dev/null</file>) shell (it
would need to be listed in <file>/etc/shells</file>). If you want to
allow users to access the system but limit their movements, you can
use the <file>/bin/rbash</file>, equivalent to adding the <tt>-r</tt>
option in <prgn>bash</prgn> (<em>RESTRICTED SHELL</em> see <manref name="bash"
section="1">). Please note that even with restricted shell, a user
that access an interactive program (that might allow execution of a
subshell) could be able to bypass the limits of the shell.

<p>Debian currently provides in the unstable release (and might be included in 
the next stable releases) the <file>pam_chroot</file> module (in the <package>
libpam-chroot</package>). An alternative to it is to <prgn>chroot</prgn> the 
service that provides remote logging (<prgn>ssh</prgn>, <prgn>telnet</prgn>).
<footnote><package>Libpam-chroot</package> has not been yet thoroughly
tested, it does work for <prgn>login</prgn> but it might not be easy to set up 
the environment for other programs</footnote>

<p>If you wish to restrict <em>when</em> users can access the system you will
have to customize <file>/etc/security/access.conf</file> for your
needs.

<p>Information on how to <prgn>chroot</prgn> users accessing the
system through the <prgn>ssh</prgn> service is described in <ref
id="chroot-ssh-env">.

<sect1>Hand-made user auditing

<p>If you are paranoid you might want to add a system-wide
<file>/etc/profile</file> that sets the
environment in a way such that they cannot remove audit capabilities
from the shell (commands are dumped to <tt>$HISTFILE</tt>. The
<file>/etc/profile</file> could be set as follows:

<example>
  HISTFILE=~/.bash_history
  HISTSIZE=100000000000000000
  HISTFILESIZE=10000000000000000
  readonly HISTFILE
  readonly HISTSIZE
  readonly HISTFILESIZE
  export HISTFILE HISTSIZE HISTFILESIZE
</example>

<p>For this to work the user can only append information to
<file>.bash_history</file>. You need <em>also</em> to set the 
<em>append-only</em> option using <prgn>chattr</prgn> program 
for <file>.bash_history</file> for all users.
<footnote>
Without the append-only flag users would be able to empty the 
contents of the history file running <prgn> >.bash_history</prgn>
</footnote>.

<p>Note that you could do that per user's <file>.profile</file>. But
then you would need to setup permissions properly: having the user's
home directories <em>not</em> belong to the users but enable them
to read the configuration <file>.profile</file> and write on the
<file>.bash_history</file>. It would be good to set
the <em>inmutable</em> flag (also using <prgn>chattr</prgn>)
for <file>.profile</file> too if you do it this way.

<p>If you are completely paranoid and want to audit every user's command, you 
could take <prgn>bash</prgn> source code, edit it and have it send all that 
the user typed into another file. Or have <package>ttysnoop</package> 
constantly monitor any new ttys
<footnote>Ttys are spawned for local logins and remote logins through ssh and telnte</footnote>
and dump the output into a file. Other useful 
program is <package>snoopy</package> 
(see also  <url id="http://sourceforge.net/projects/snoopylogger/" name="the project page">)
which is a user-transparent program that 
hooks in as a library providing a wrapper around <var>execve()</var> 
calls, any command executed is logged to <prgn>syslogd</prgn> using the 
<tt>authpriv</tt> facility (usually stored at <file>/var/log/auth.log</file>).

<p>Note that you cannot use the <prgn>script</prgn> command for this since it 
will not work as a shell (even if you add it to <file>/etc/shells</file>).

<sect1>Complete user audit

<p>The previous example is a simple way to configure user auditing
which might be not useful for complex systems. If this is your case,
you need to look at <package>acct</package>, the accounting
utilities. These will log all the commands run by users or processes
in the system, at the expense of disk space.

<p>When activating accounting, all the information on processes and
users is kept under <file>/var/account/</file>, more specifically in
the <file>pacct</file>. The accounting package includes some tools
(<prgn>sa</prgn> and <prgn>ac</prgn>) to analyse this data.

<sect1>Reviewing user profiles

<p>If you want to <em>see</em> what users are usually doing, when they are
connecting you can use the <file>wtmp</file> database that
includes all login information. This file can be processed with
several utilities, amongst them <prgn>sac</prgn> which can output a
profile on each user showing in which timeframe they usually log on to
the system.

<p>In case you have accounting activated, you can also use the tools
provided by it in order to determine when the users access the
system and what they execute. 

<sect1>Setting users umasks

<p>Depending on your user policy you might want to change how
information is shared between users, that is, what the default
permissions of new files created by users are. This change is set by
defining a proper <tt>umask</tt> setting for all users. You can change
the <var>UMASK</var> setting in <file>/etc/limits.conf</file>,
<file>/etc/profile</file>, <file>/etc/csh.cshrc</file>,
<file>/etc/csh.login</file>, <file>/etc/zshrc</file> and probably some
others (depending on the shells you have installed on your system). Of
all of these the last one that gets loaded takes precedence. The order
is: PAM's <file>limits.conf</file>, the default system configuration 
for the user's shell, the user's shell (his <file>~/.profile</file>,
<file>~/.bash_profile</file>...)

<p>Debian's default <tt>umask</tt> setting is <em>022</em> this means
that files (and directories) can be read and accessed by the user's
group and by any other users in the system. If this is too permissive
for your system you will have to change the umask setting for all the
shells (and for PAM). Don't forget to modify the files under
<file>/etc/skel/</file> since these will be new user's defaults when
created with the <prgn>adduser</prgn> command.

<p>Note, however that users can modify their own <tt>umask</tt> setting if they
want too, making it more permissive or more restricted.

<sect1>Limiting what users can see/access

<P>FIXME: Content needed. Tell of consequences of changing packages 
permissions when upgrading (and admin this paranoid should <prgn>chroot</prgn> 
his users BTW).

<p>If you need to grant users access to the system with a shell think
about it very carefully. A user can, by default unless in a severely
restricted environment (like a <tt>chroot</tt> jail), retrieve
quite a lot of information from your system including:

<list>

<item>some configuration files in <file>/etc</file>. However, Debian's default
permissions for some sensitive files (which might, for example,
contain passwords), will prevent access to critical information. To
see which files are only accessible by the root user
for example <tt>find /etc -type f -a -perm 600 -a -uid 0</tt> as
superuser.

<item>your installed packages, either by looking at the package
database, at the <file>/usr/share/doc</file> directory or by guessing
by looking at the binaries and libraries installed in your system.

<item>some log files at <file>/var/log</file>. Note also that some
log files are only accessible to root and the <tt>adm</tt> group (try
<tt>find /var/log -type f -a -perm 640</tt>) and some are even only
available to the root user (try <tt>find /var/log -type f -a -perm
600 -a -uid 0</tt>).

</list>


<p>What can a user see in your system? Probably quite a lot of things,
try this (take a deep breath):
<example>
  find / -type f -a -perm +006 2>/dev/null  
  find / -type d -a -perm +007 2>/dev/null  
</example>

<p>The output is the list of files that a user can <em>see</em> and
the directories to which he has access.

<sect2 id="limit-user-perm">Limiting access to other user's information

<p>If you still grant shell access to users you might want to limit
what information they can view from other users. Users with shell
access have a tendency to create quite a number of files under their
$HOMEs: mailboxes, personal documents, configuration of X/GNOME/KDE
applications... 

<p>In Debian each user is created with one associated group, and
no two users belong to the same group. This is the default behavior:
when the userX is created a group with name userX is created and the
user is assigned to it. This avoids the concept of a <em>users</em>
group which might make it more difficult for users to hide information
from other users.

<p>However, users' <var>$HOME</var> directories are created with 0755 
permissions (group-readable and world-readable). The group permissions is not 
an issue since only the user belongs to the group, however the world 
permissions might (or might not) be an issue depending on your local policy.

<p>You can change this behaviour so that user creation provides different 
<var>$HOME</var> permissions. To change the behaviour for <em>new</em> users 
when they get created, change <em>DIR_MODE</em> in the configuration file 
<file>/etc/adduser.conf</file> to 0750 (no world-readable access).

<p>Users can still share information, but not directly in their 
<var>$HOME</var> directories unless they change its permissions.

<p>Note that this will prevent users from being able to set up
personal pages (<file>~userX</file>) if a web server is present, since the web
server will not be able to read the <var>$HOME</var> directory and thus, the
<file>public_html</file> directory under it. If you want to permit
users to publish HTML pages in their <file>~userX/public_html</file>
then change  <em>DIR_MODE</em> to 0751. This will allow the webserver
to access that directory (which should be mode 0755) and provide the content
published by users.

<sect1 id="user-pwgen">Generating user passwords

<p>There are many cases when an administrator needs to create many
user accounts and provide passwords for all of them. Of course, the
administrator could easily just set the password to be the same as the
user's account name, but that would not be very sensitive
security-wise. A better approach is to use a password generating
program. Debian provides <package>makepasswd</package>,
<package>apg</package> and <package>pwgen</package> packages which
provide programs (the name is the same as the package) that can be
used for this purpose. <prgn>Makepasswd</prgn> will generate true
random passwords with an emphasis on security over pronounceability
while <prgn>pwgen</prgn> will try to make meaningless but
pronounceable passwords (of course this might depend on your mother
language). <prgn>Apg</prgn> has algorithms to provide for both (there
is a client/server version for this program but it is not included in
the Debian package).

<p><prgn>Passwd</prgn> does not allow non-interactive assignation of
passwords (since it uses direct tty access). If you want to change
passwords when creating a large number of users you can create them
using <prgn>adduser</prgn> with the <tt>--disabled-login</tt> option
and then use <prgn>chpasswd</prgn>
<footnote>
<prgn>Chpasswd</prgn> cannot handle MD5 password generation so it needs to be 
given the password in encrypted form before using it, with the <tt>-e</tt>
option.
</footnote>
(in the <package>passwd</package> package so you already have it
installed). If you want to use a file with all the information to make
users as a batch process you might be better off using
<prgn>newusers</prgn>.

<sect1>Checking user passwords

<p>User passwords can sometimes become the <em>weakest link</em> in the 
security of a given system. This is due to some users choosing weak passwords 
for their accounts (and the more of them that have access to it the greater 
the chances of this happening). Even if you established checks with the 
cracklib PAM module and password limits as described in <ref id="auth-pam"> 
users will still be able to use weak passwords. Since user access might 
include remote shell access (over <prgn>ssh</prgn>, hopefully) it's important 
that a remote attacker is not able to guess user passwords (after he has been 
able to do user enumeration by other means).

<p>A system administrator must, given a big number of users, check if
the passwords they have are consistent with the local security
policy. How to check? Try to crack them as an attacker would if he had
access to the hashed passwords (the <file>/etc/shadow</file> file). 

<p>An administrator can use <package>john</package> or <package>crack</package>
(both are brute force password crackers) together with an appropriate wordlist 
<footnote>Try <prgn>apt-cache search wordlist</prgn> for a list of
available packages which might provide wordlists. You can also
retrieve wordlists from many ftp sites over the Internet. See
<url id="ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists"> or
<url id="ftp://ftp.cerias.purdue.edu/pub/dict">.</footnote>
to check users' passwords and take appropriate action when a weak
password is detected.

<sect1 id="idle-logoff">Logging off idle users

<p>Idle users are usually a security problem, a user might be idle
maybe because he's out to lunch or because a remote connection was
broken and not re-established. For whatever the reason, idle users
might lead to a compromise:

<list>
<item>because the user's console might not be locked and can be
accessed by an intruder.  

<item>because an attacker might be able to re-attach himself to a
closed network connection and send commands to the remote shell (this
is fairly easy if the remote shell is not encrypted as in the case of
<prgn>telnet</prgn>).
</list>

<p>Some remote systems have even been compromised
through an idle (detached) <prgn>screen</prgn>.

<p>Automatic disconnection of idle users is usually a part of the local 
security policy that must be enforced. There are several ways to do this:

<list>
<item>If <prgn>bash</prgn> is the user shell, a system administrator 
can set a default <tt>TMOUT</tt> value (see <manref section="1" name="bash">) 
which will make the shell automatically remote idle users. Note that it 
must be set with the <tt>-o</tt> option or users will be able to 
change (or unset) it.

<item>Install <package>timeoutd</package> and configure
<file>/etc/timeouts</file> according to your local security
policy. The daemon will watch for idle users and time out their shells
accordingly.

<item>Install <package>autolog</package> and configure it to remove idle users.

</list>

<p>The <prgn>timeoutd</prgn> or <prgn>autolog</prgn> daemons are the
preferred method since, after all, users can change their default shell
or can, after running their default shell, switch to another
(uncontrolled) shell.


<sect>Using tcpwrappers 

<p>TCP wrappers were developed when there were no real packet filters
available and access control was needed. The TCP wrappers allow you to
allow or deny a service for a host or a domain and define a default
allow or deny rule.  If you want more information take a look at
<manref name="hosts_access" section="5">.

<p>Many services installed in Debian are either:

<list>
<item>launched through the tcpwrapper service (<file>tcpd</file>)
<item>compiled with libwrapper support built-in.
</list>

<p>On the one hand, for services configured in
<file>/etc/inetd.conf</file> (this includes <prgn>telnet</prgn>, 
<prgn>ftp</prgn>, <prgn>netbios</prgn>, <prgn>swat</prgn>
and <prgn>finger</prgn>) you will see that the configuration file executes
<prgn>/usr/sbin/tcpd</prgn> first. On the other hand, even if a
service is not launched by the <prgn>inetd</prgn> superdaemon,
support for the tcp wrappers rules can be compiled
into it. Services compiled with tcp wrappers in Debian include
<prgn>ssh, portmap, in.talk, rpc.statd, rpc.mountd, gdm, oaf</prgn> (the GNOME
activator daemon), <prgn>nessus</prgn> and many others. 

<p>To see which packages use tcpwrappers try:

<example>
  $ apt-cache showpkg libwrap0 | egrep '^[[:space:]]' | sort -u | \
        sed 's/,libwrap0$//;s/^[[:space:]]\+//'
</example>


<p>Take this into account when running <prgn>tcpchk</prgn>.
You can add services that are linked to the wrapper library into
the <file>hosts.deny</file> and <file>hosts.allow</file> files but
<prgn>tcpchk</prgn> will warn that it is not able to find
those services since it looks for them in <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file>
(the manpage is not totally accurate here).

<p>Now, here comes a small trick, and probably the smallest intrusion 
detection system available. In general, you should have a decent firewall 
policy as a first line, and tcp wrappers as the second line of defense. One 
little trick is to set up a <var>SPAWN</var> <footnote>be sure to use 
uppercase here since <em>spawn</em> will not work</footnote> command in 
<file>/etc/hosts.deny</file> that sends mail to root whenever a denied service
triggers wrappers:

<example>
  ALL: ALL: SPAWN ( \
    echo -e "\n\
    TCP Wrappers\: Connection refused\n\
    By\: $(uname -n)\n\
    Process\: %d (pid %p)\n\
    User\: %u\n\
    Host\: %c\n\
    Date\: $(date)\n\
  " | /usr/bin/mail -s "Connection to %d blocked" root) &
</example>

<p><em>Beware</em>: The above printed example is open to a DoS attack by
making many connections in a short period of time. Many emails mean
a lot of file I/O by sending only a few packets.

<!--
# Could this example be more interesting? 
# It also relates to the next section (jfs)
#
# era: cf hosts_access(5) manual page,
# and why are you not using logger(1) here? (FIXME?)
#
#&lt;example&gt;
#ALL: ALL: SPAWN ( \
#  /usr/local/sbin/send_syslog %u %c %d )
#&lt;example&gt;

#  With send_syslog as:
##!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
#use Sys::Syslog qw(:DEFAULT setlogsock);
#
#$user=shift(@ARGV) || 'unknown';
#$host=shift(@ARGV) || 'unknown';
#$service=shift(@ARGV) || 'unknown';
#setlogsock('unix');
#openlog("alert",'', 'user');
#syslog('warning', 'Connection from %s at %s to %s blocked.', ($user, $host, $service) );
#closelog();
#
#exit 0;
-->

<sect id="log-alerts">The importance of logs and alerts

<p>It is easy to see that the treatment of logs and alerts is an
important issue in a secure system. Suppose a system is perfectly
configured and 99% secure. If the 1% attack occurs, and there are no
security measures in place to, first, detect this and, second, raise
alarms, the system is not secure at all.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux provides some tools to perform log analysis, most notably 
<package>swatch</package>, <footnote>there's a very good article on it written 
by <url id="http://www.enteract.com/~lspitz/swatch.html" name="Lance Spitzner">
</footnote> <package>logcheck</package> or <package>log-analysis</package> 
(all will need some customisation to remove unnecessary things from the 
report). It might also be useful, if the system is nearby, to have the system 
logs printed on a virtual console. This is useful since you can (from a 
distance) see if the system is behaving properly. Debian's 
<file>/etc/syslog.conf</file> comes with a commented default configuration; to 
enable it uncomment the lines and restart <prgn>syslogd</prgn> (
<tt>/etc/init.d/syslogd restart</tt>):

<example>
  daemon,mail.*;\
        news.=crit;news.=err;news.=notice;\
        *.=debug;*.=info;\
        *.=notice;*.=warn       /dev/tty8

<sect1 id="custom-logcheck">Using and customising <prgn>logcheck</prgn>

<p>The <prgn>logcheck</prgn> package in Debian is divided into the
three packages <package>logcheck</package> (the main program),
<package>logcheck-database</package> (a database of regular
expressions for the program) and <package>logtail</package> (prints
loglines that have not yet been read). The Debian default (in
<file>/etc/cron.d/logcheck</file>) is that <prgn>logcheck</prgn> is run
every hour just off the hour and once after each reboot.

<p>This tool can be quite useful if properly customised to alert the
administrator to unusual events in the system. <prgn>Logcheck</prgn>
can be fully customised so that it can send mails from events
recovered from the logs that are worthy of attention. The default
installation includes profiles for ignored events and policy
violations for three different setups (workstation, server and
paranoid). The Debian package includes a configuration file
<file>/etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf</file>, sourced by the program, that
defines which user the checks are sent to. It also provides a way for
packages that provide services to implement new policies in the
directories: <file>/etc/logcheck/cracking.d/_packagename_</file>,
<file>/etc/logcheck/violations.d/_packagename_</file>,
<file>/etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d/_packagename_</file>,
<file>/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid/_packagename_</file>,
<file>/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/_packagename_</file>, and
<file>/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.workstation/_packagename_</file>. However,
not many packages currently do so. If you have a policy that can be
useful for other users, please send it as a bug report for the
appropriate package (as a <em>wishlist</em> bug). For more information read
<file>/usr/share/doc/logcheck/README.Debian</file>.

<p>The best way to configure <prgn>logcheck</prgn> is to edit its
main configuration file <file>/etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf</file>
after installation. Change the default user (root) to whom reports 
should be mailed. You should set the reportlevel in there, too.
<package>logcheck-database</package> has three report levels of 
increasing verbosity: workstation, server, paranoid.
"server" beeing the default level, paranoid is only recommended
for high-security machines running as few services as possible
and workstation for relatively sheltered, non-critical machines.
If you wish to add new log files just add them to
<file>/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles</file>. It is tuned for default
syslog install.

<p>Once this is done you might want to check the mails that are sent, for the 
first few days/weeks/months. If you find you are sent messages you do not wish 
to receive, just add the regular expressions (see
<manref name="regex" section="7"> and <manref name="egrep" section="1">) that
correspond to these messages to the
<file>/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.<var>reportlevel</var>/local</file>.
Try to match the whole logline. Details on howto write rules are explained in
<file>/usr/share/doc/logcheck-database/README.logcheck-database.gz</file>.
It's an ongoing tuning process; once the messages that are sent are always
relevant you can consider the tuning finished.  Note that if
<prgn>logcheck</prgn> does not find anything relevant in your system
it will not mail you even if it does run (so you might get a mail only
once a week, if you are lucky).


<sect1>Configuring where alerts are sent

<p>Debian comes with a standard <tt>syslog</tt> configuration (in 
<file>/etc/syslog.conf</file>) that logs messages to the appropriate files 
depending on the system facility.  You should be familiar with this; have a 
look at the <file>syslog.conf</file> file and the documentation if not. If you 
intend to maintain a secure system you should be aware of where log messages 
are sent so they do not go unnoticed.

<p>For example, sending messages to the console also is an interesting
setup useful for many production-level systems. But for many such
systems it is also important to add a new machine that will serve as
loghost (i.e. it receives logs from all other systems).

<p>Root's mail should be considered also, many security controls (like
<package>snort</package>) send alerts to root's mailbox. This 
mailbox usually points to
the first user created in the system (check <file>/etc/aliases</file>).
Take care to send root's mail to some place where it will be read (either
locally or remotely).

<p>There are other role accounts and aliases on your system.  On a
small system, it's probably simplest to make sure that all such
aliases point to the root account, and that mail to root is forwarded
to the system administrator's personal mailbox.

<p>FIXME: it would be interesting to tell how a Debian system can
send/receive SNMP traps related to security problems (jfs). Check:
<package>snmptraglogd</package>, <package>snmp</package> and
<package>snmpd</package>.


<sect1>Using a loghost

<p>A loghost is a host which collects syslog data remotely over the
network. If one of your machines is cracked, the intruder is not able
to cover his tracks, unless he hacks the loghost as well.  So, the
loghost should be especially secure.  Making a machine a loghost is
simple. Just start the <prgn>syslogd</prgn> with <tt>syslogd -r</tt> 
and a new loghost is born. In order to do this permanently in Debian, edit
<file>/etc/init.d/sysklogd</file> and change the line

<!-- FIXME: The following could also be interesting -->
<!-- How to hide the logging server on the network i.e. by not giving -->
<!-- it an IP address and adding a static ARP entry on the hosts using -->
<!-- the remote syslog server (only if on the same hub); if the remote -->
<!-- syslog server would be on a separate network, the default gateway -->
<!-- should be configured accordingly -->

<example>
  SYSLOGD=""
</example>
to 
<example>
  SYSLOGD="-r"
</example>

Next, configure the other machines to send data to the loghost. Add
an entry like the following to <file>/etc/syslog.conf</file>:

<example>
  facility.level            @your_loghost
</example>

See the documentation for what to use in place of <em>facility</em>
and <em>level</em> (they should not be entered verbatim like this).
If you want to log everything remotely, just write:

<example>
  *.*                       @your_loghost
</example>

into your <file>syslog.conf</file>. Logging remotely as well as locally 
is the best solution (the attacker might presume to have covered 
his tracks after deleting the local log files). See the <manref name="syslog"
section="3">, <manref name="syslogd" section="8"> and <manref
name="syslog.conf" section="5"> manpages for additional information.


<sect1>Log file permissions

<p>It is not only important to decide how alerts are used, but also
who has read/modify access to the log files (if not
using a remote loghost).  Security alerts which the attacker can
change or disable are not worth much in the event of an intrusion.
Also, you have to take into account that log files might reveal
quite a lot of information about your system to an intruder 
if he has access to them.

<!--  It should be explained why after installation this is not
 already done, jfs -->

<p>Some log file permissions are not perfect after the installation (but of 
course this really depends on your local security policy). First 
<file>/var/log/lastlog</file> and <file>/var/log/faillog</file> do not need to 
be readable by normal users. In the <file>lastlog</file> file you can see who 
logged in recently, and in the <file>faillog</file> you see a summary of failed
logins. The author recommends <prgn>chmod 660</prgn> for both. Take a brief 
look at your log files and decide very carefully which log files to make 
readable/writeable for a user with a UID other than 0 and a group other than 
'adm' or 'root'. You can easily check this in your system with:

<example>
  #  find /var/log -type f -exec ls -l {} \; | cut -c 17-35 |sort -u
  (see to what users do files in /var/log belong)
  #  find /var/log -type f -exec ls -l {} \; | cut -c 26-34 |sort -u
  (see to what groups do files in /var/log belong)
  # find /var/log -perm +004
  (files which are readable by any user)
  #  find /var/log \! -group root \! -group adm -exec ls -ld {} \;
  (files which belong to groups not root or adm)
</example>

<p>To customize how log files are created you will probably have to
customize the program that generates them. If the log file gets
rotated, however, you can customize the behavior of creation and rotation.

<!-- This is no longer true, check apache's logrotate
<p>
I want to emphasize that the apache log file permissions are really
screwed due to the fact that the apache user owns the apache log
files. If a user gets a shell with a back door in apache, they can
easily remove the log files.

<sect id="kernel-patches">Adding kernel patches
<!-- last edited by Frdric Schtz <schutz@mathgen.ch> -->


<p>Debian GNU/Linux provides some of the patches for the Linux kernel
that enhance its security. These include:

<list>

<item>Linux Intrusion Detection (in package <package>lids-2.2.19</package>),
by Huagang Xie and Philippe Biondi. This kernel patch makes the
process of hardening your Linux system easier by allowing you to
restrict, hide and protect processes, even from root. It also allows
you to protect or hide certain files so that even root cannot modify
them. Furthermore, you can also set capabilities for certain
processes. A must for the paranoid system administrator. Homepage:
<url id="http://www.lids.org" name="http://www.lids.org">

<item><em>POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Linux</em> (in package
<package>kernel-patch-acl</package>). This kernel patch adds access
control lists, an advanced method for restricting access to files. It
allows you to control fine-grain access to files and directory. This
patch has been added to the 2.5 development kernel and will be
included by default in the future 2.6 Kernel. Homepage: <url
name="http://acl.bestbits.at/" id="http://acl.bestbits.at/">

<item>Linux Trustees (in package <package>trustees</package>). This patch
adds a decent advanced permissions management system to your Linux kernel.
Special objects (called trustees) are bound to every file or directory, and
are stored in kernel memory, which allows fast lookup of all permissions.
Homepage: <url name="http://trustees.sourceforge.net/"
id="http://trustees.sourceforge.net/">

<item>NSA Enhanced Linux (in package <package>selinux</package> also 
available from 
<url id="http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/" name="the developer's website">)

<item><package>kernel-patch-2.2.18-openwall</package>, by Solar
Designer. This is a useful set of kernel restrictions, like restricted
links, FIFOs in <file>/tmp</file>, a restricted <file>/proc</file>
file system, special file descriptor handling, non-executable user
stack area and other. Homepage: <url
name="http://www.openwall.com/linux/"

<item><package>kernel-patch-2.4-grsecurity</package>: The Grsecurity
patch, for 2.4 kernels only
<footnote>
Notice that, depending on the 2.4 kernel source package you use you
might encounter some issues patching the kernel sources. If this is
your case you might need to use the stock vanilla kernel. You can do this
with the following steps:
<example>
# apt-get install kernel-source-2.4.22 kernel-patch-debian-2.4.22
# tar xjf /usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.22.tar.bz2

<item><package>kernel-patch-2.2.19-harden</package>. <em>FIXME</em>
Add content.

<item>IPSEC kernel support (in package
<package>kernel-patch-freeswan</package>). If you want to use the
IPsec protocol with Linux, you need this patch. You can create VPNs
with this quite easily, even to Windows machines, as IPsec is a common
standard. IPSec capabilities have been added to the 2.5 development
kernel, so this feature will be present by default in the future Linux
Kernel 2.6. Homepage: <url id="http://www.freeswan.org">. 

<em>FIXME</em>: The latest 2.4 kernels provided in Debian include a backport of
the IPSEC code from 2.5. Comment on this.

<item><package>cryptoapi-core-source</package>. This patch adds
cryptographic capabilities to the Linux kernel, like ciphers and
digests functions. Common uses of these functions are filesystem or
swap encryption. Note that as of version 2.5.45, similar capabilities
have been added to the official Linux kernel source, so it is likely
that you won't need this patch anymore with the future 2.6 kernel.
<em>Note</em>: this package does not exist in Debian releases prior to 
<url id="http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/" name="Sarge">.
Homepage: <url name="http://www.kerneli.org/" id="http://www.kerneli.org/">

<item><package>cryptoloop-source</package>. This patches allows you to
use the functions of the <package>crytoapi-core-source</package> package
to create encrypted filesystems using the loopback device.

<item><package>kernel-patch-int</package>. This patch also adds
cryptographic capabilities to the Linux kernel, and was useful with
Debian releases up to Potato. It doesn't work with Woody, and if you
are using Sarge or a newer version, you should use the more recent
<package>cryptoapi-core-source</package>.

<sect>Protecting against buffer overflows

<p><em>Buffer overflow</em> is the name of a common attack to software
<footnote>So common, in fact, that they have been the basis of 20% of the
reported security vulnerabilities every year, as determined by 
<url id="http://icat.nist.gov/icat.cfm?function=statistics"
name="statistics from ICAT's vulnerability database"></footnote>
which makes use of insufficient boundary checking (a 
programming error) in order to execute machine code through a
program's inputs. These attacks, against server software which listen
to connections remotely and against local software which grant higher
privileges to users (<tt>setuid</tt> or <tt>setgid</tt>) can result in the 
compromise of any given system.

<p>There are mainly four methods to protect against buffer overflows:

<list>

<item>patch the kernel to prevent stack execution (you can use the
OpenWall or Grsecurity patches)

<!-- FIXME: add a link to libsafe to the main place -->

<item>using a library, such as <url
id="http://www.research.avayalabs.com/project/libsafe/"
name="libsafe">, to overwrite vulnerable functions and introduce
proper checking (for information on how to install libsafe read <url
id="http://www.Linux-Sec.net/harden/libsafe.uhow2.txt" name="this">).

<item>fix the source code by using tools to find fragments of it that
might introduce this vulnerability.

<item>recompile the source code to introduce proper checks that
prevent overflows, using, for example, <url
id="http://www.immunix.org/stackguard.html" name="StackGuard"> (which
is used by <url id="http://www.immunix.org" name="Immunix">) or the <url
id="http://www.research.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp/" name="Stack
Smashing Protector (SSP)"> patch for GCC (which is used by <url
id="http://www.adamantix.org" name="Adamantix">)

</list>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux, as of the 3.0 release, provides software to
introduce all of these methods expect for the protection on source
code compilation (but this has been requested in <url
id="http://bugs.debian.org/213994" name="Bug #213994">)

<p>Notice that even if Debian provided a compiler which featured
stack/buffer overflow protection all packages would need to be
recompiled in order to introduce this feature. This is, in fact, what
Adamantix does (among other features). The effect of this new feature
on the stability of software is yet to be determined (some programs or
some processor architecures might break due to it).

<p>In any case, be aware, that even these workarounds might not
prevent buffer overflows since there are ways to circumvent these, as
described in phrack's magazine <url name="issue 58"
id="http://packetstorm.linuxsecurity.com/mag/phrack/phrack58.tar.gz">
or in CORE's Advisory
<url id="http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/269246"
name="Multiple vulnerabilities in stack smashing protection technologies">.

<sect1>Kernel patch protection for buffer overflows

<p>Kernel patches related to buffer overflows include the Openwall
patch provides protection against buffer overflows in 2.2 linux
kernels. For 2.4 kernels, you need to use the Grsecurity patch (in the
<package> kernel-patch-2.4-grsecurity</package>) which includes the
Openwall patch and many more <url
id="http://www.grsecurity.net/features.php" name="features">
(including ACLs and network randomness to make it more difficult to
remote OS fingerprinting), or the Linux Security Modules (in the
<package>kernel-patch-2.4-lsm</package> and
<package>kernel-patch-2.5-lsm</package> packages).
For more information on using these patches read the the section <ref
id="kernel-patches">.

<sect1>Libsafe protection

<p>Protecting a Debian GNU/Linux system with
<package>libsafe</package> is rather easy. Just install the package
and say <em>Yes</em> to have the library preloaded globally. Be
careful, however, since this might break software (notably, programs
linked with the old <prgn>libc5</prgn>, so make sure to read the <url
id="http://bugs.debian.org/libsafe" name="reported bug reports"> first
and test the most critical programs in your system first with the
<prgn>libsafe</prgn> wrapper program.

<p><em>Important Note</em>: Libsafe protection might not be effective
currently as describe in <url id="http://bugs.debian.org/173227"
name="173227">. Consider testing it thoroughly before using it in a
production environment and don't depend exclusively on it to protect
your system.

<sect1>Testing programs for overflows

<p>The use of tools to detect buffer overflows requires, in any case,
of programming experience in order to fix (and recompile) the
code. Debian provides, for example: <package>bfbtester</package> (a
buffer overflow tester that brute-forces binaries through command line
and environment overflows) and <package>njamd</package>.


<sect>Secure file transfers 

<p>During normal system administration one usually needs to transfer
files in and out from the installed system. Copying files in a secure
manner from a host to another can be achieved by using the
<package>sshd</package> server package. Another possibility is the use
of <package>ftpd-ssl</package>, a ftp server which uses the <em>Secure
Socket Layer</em> to encrypt the transmissions.

<p>Any of these methods needs, of course, special clients. Debian
provides clients, for example the <package>ssh</package> provides
<prgn>scp</prgn>.  It works like <prgn>rcp</prgn> but is encrypted
completely, so the <em>bad guys</em> cannot even find out WHAT you
copy. There is also a <package>ftp-ssl</package> client package for
the equivalent server. You can find clients for these software even
for other operating systems (non-UNIX), <prgn>putty</prgn> and
<prgn>winscp</prgn> provide secure copy implementations for any
version of Microsoft's operating system.

<p>Note that using <prgn>scp</prgn> provides access to the users to
all the file system unless <prgn>chroot</prgn>'ed as described in <ref
id="ssh-chroot">. FTP access can be <prgn>chroot</prgn>'ed, probably easier
depending on you chosen daemon, as described in <ref
id="ftp-secure">. If you are worried about users browsing your local
files and want to have encrypted communication you can either use an
ftp daemon with SSL support or combine cleartext ftp and a VPN setup
(see <ref id="vpn">).

<sect>File System limits and control

<sect1>Using quotas

<p>
Having a good quota policy is important, as it keeps users from
filling up the hard disk(s).
<p>
You can use two different quota systems: user quota and group
quota. As you probably figured out, user quota limits the amount of
space a user can take up, group quota does the equivalent for
groups. Keep this in mind when you're working out quota sizes.

<p>There are a few important points to think about in setting up a
quota system:

<list>
<item>Keep the quotas small enough, so users do not eat up your disk
space.

<item>Keep the quotas big enough, so users do not complain or their mail quota
keeps them from accepting mail over a longer period.

<item>Use quotas on all user-writable areas, on <file>/home</file> as well 
as on <file>/tmp</file>.
</list>

<p>Every partition or directory which users have full write access should
be quota enabled. Calculate and assign a workable quota size for those 
partitions and directories which combines usability and security.

<p>So, now you want to use quotas. First of all you need to check
whether you enabled quota support in your kernel. If not, you will
need to recompile it. After this, control whether the package 
<package>quota</package> is installed. If not you will need this one as well.

<!-- FIXME: how to check for quota support? What to tweak when
recompiling? -->

<p>
Enabling quota for the respective file systems is as easy as modifying
the <tt>defaults</tt> setting to <tt>defaults,usrquota</tt> in your
<file>/etc/fstab</file> file. If you need group quota, substitute
<tt>usrquota</tt> to <tt>grpquota</tt>.  You can also use them both.
Then create empty quota.user and quota.group files in the roots of the
file systems you want to use quotas on (e.g.  <tt>touch
/home/quota.user /home/quota.group</tt> for a <file>/home</file> file system).

<p>
Restart quota by doing <tt>/etc/init.d/quota stop;/etc/init.d/quota
start</tt>. Now quota should be running, and quota sizes can be set.

<p>
Editing quotas for a specific user (say 'ref') can be done by
<tt>edquota -u ref</tt>. Group quotas can be modified with <tt>edquota -g
&lt;group&gt;</tt>. Then set the soft and hard quota and/or inode quotas 
as needed.

<p>
For more information about quotas, read the quota man page, and the quota
mini-howto(<file>/usr/share/doc/HOWTO/en-html/mini/Quota.html</file>).

<p>You might or might not like <package>lshell</package>, since it
violates the FHS. Also take into account that pam_limits.so might
provide the same functionality and <package>lshell</package>
is currently <url id="http://bugs.debian.org/93894" name="orphaned">

<sect1 id="ext2attr">The ext2 filesystem specific attributes (chattr/lsattr) 
<!-- section last edited by Frdric Schtz <schutz@mathgen.ch> -->

<p>
In addition to the usual Unix permissions, the ext2 and ext3
filesystems offer a set of specific attributes that give you more
control over the files on your system. Unlike the basic permissions,
these attributes are not displayed by the usual <prgn>ls -l</prgn>
command or changed using <prgn>chmod</prgn>, and you need two other
utilities, <prgn>lsattr</prgn> and <prgn>chattr</prgn> (in package
<package>e2fsprogs</package>) to manage them. Note that this means
that these attributes will usually not be saved when you backup
your system, so if you change any of them, it may be worth
saving the successive <prgn>chattr</prgn> commands in a script so that
you can set them again later if you have to restore a backup.

<p>
Among all available attributes, the two that are most important for
increasing security are referenced by the letters 'i' and 'a', and
they can only be set (or removed) by the superuser:

<list>
<item>The 'i' attribute ('immutable'): a file with this attribute can
neither be modified nor deleted or renamed and no link can be created
to it, even by the superuser.

<item>The 'a' attribute ('append'): this attribute has the same effect
that the immutable attribute, except that you can still open the file
in append mode. This means that you can still add more content to it
but it is impossible to modify previous content. This attribute is
especially useful for the log files stored in <file>/var/log/</file>,
though you should consider that they get moved sometimes due to the
log rotation scripts.
</list>

<p>
These attributes can also be set for directories, in which case
everyone is denied the right to modify the contents of a directory
list (eg. rename or remove a file, ...). When applied to a directory,
the append attribute only allows file creation.

<p>
It is easy to see how the 'a' attribute improves security, by giving
to programs that are not running as the superuser the ability to add
data to a file without modifying its previous content. On the other
hand, the 'i' attribute seems less interesting: after all, the
superuser can already use the basic Unix permissions to restrict
access to a file, and an intruder that would get access to the
superuser account could always use the <prgn>chattr</prgn> program to
remove the attribute. Such an intruder may first be confused when he
sees that he is not able to remove a file, but you should not assume
that he is blind - after all, he got into your system ! Some manuals
(including a previous version of this document) suggest to simply
remove the <prgn>chattr</prgn> and <prgn>lsattr</prgn> programs from
the system to increase security, but this kind of strategy, also known
as "security by obscurity", is to be absolutely avoided, since it
provides a false sense of security.

<p>
A secure way to solve this problem is to use the capabilities of the Linux
kernel, as described in <ref id="proactive">. The capability of
interest here is called <tt>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</tt>: if you remove it
from the capabilities bounding set (using for example the command
<tt>lcap CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</tt>) it won't be possible to change any
'a' or 'i' attribute on your system anymore, even by the superuser ! A
complete strategy could be as follows:

<enumlist>
  <item> Set the attributes 'a' and 'i' on any file you want;
  <item> Add the command <tt>lcap CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</tt> (as well as
         <tt>lcap CAP_SYS_MODULE</tt>, as suggested in <ref id="proactive">)
         to one of the startup scripts;
<!-- Is there anything interesting in :
http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2001/debian-security-200107/msg00024.html -->
  <item> Set the 'i' attribute on this script and other startup files, as
         well as on the <prgn>lcap</prgn> binary itself;
  <item> Execute the above command manually (or reboot your system to
         make sure everything works as planned).
</enumlist>

<p>
Now that the capability has been removed from the system, an intruder
can not change any attribute on the protected files, and thus can not
change or remove the files. If he forces the machine to reboot (which
is the only way to restore the capabilities bounding set), it will
easily be detected, and the capability will be removed again as soon
as the system restarts anyway. The only way to change a protected file
would be to boot the system in single-user mode or using another
bootdisk, two operations that require physical access to the machine !

<sect1 id="check-integ">Checking file system integrity

<p>Are you sure <file>/bin/login</file> on your hard drive is still the binary 
you installed there some months ago? What if it is a hacked version, which
stores the entered password in a hidden file or mails it in cleartext version 
all over the Internet?

<p>
The only method to have some kind of protection is to check your files
every hour/day/month (I prefer daily) by comparing the actual and the
old md5sum of this file. Two files cannot have the same md5sum (the
MD5 digest is 128 bits, so the chance that two different files will
have the same md5sum is roughly one in 3.4e3803), so you're on the
safe site here, unless someone has also hacked the algorithm that
creates md5sums on that machine. This is, well, extremely difficult
and very unlikely. You really should consider this auditing of your
binaries as very important, since it is an easy way to recognize
changes at your binaries. Common tools used for this are 
<package>sXid</package>, <package>AIDE</package> (Advanced Intrusion Detection 
Environment), <package>TripWire</package> (non-free; the new version will be 
GPL), <package>integrit</package> and <package>samhain</package>.

<p>Installing <prgn>debsums</prgn> will help to check the file system
integrity, by comparing the md5sums of every file against the md5sums
used in the Debian package archive. But beware, those files can easily
be changed.

<p>Furthermore you can replace <package>locate</package> with
<package>slocate</package>. slocate is a security enhanced version of
GNU locate. When using slocate, the user only sees the files he really
has access to and you can exclude any files or directories on the
system.

<p>FIXME: put references to the snapshot taken after installation.
<p>FIXME: Add a note regarding packages not providing debsums for all
apps installed (not mandatory).

<sect1>Setting up setuid check

<p>
Debian provides a <prgn>cron</prgn> job that runs daily in
<file>/etc/cron.daily/standard</file>. This <prgn>cron</prgn> job will run the
<prgn>/usr/sbin/checksecurity</prgn> script that will store
information of this changes.

<!-- FIXME: What is the default for this in cron package? jfs -->

<p>In order for this check to be made you must set
<tt>CHECKSECURITY_DISABLE="FALSE"</tt> in
<file>/etc/checksecurity.conf</file>. Note, this is the default, so
unless you have changed something, this option will already be set to
"FALSE".

<p>The default behavior does not send this information to the superuser
but, instead keeps daily copies of the changes in
<file>/var/log/setuid.changes</file>. You should set the
CHECKSECURITY_EMAIL (in <file>/etc/checksecurity.conf</file>) to 'root' to
have this information mailed to him.  .  See <manref
name="checksecurity" section="8"> for more configuration info.

<sect id="network-secure">Securing network access

<p>FIXME. More (Debian-specific) content needed


<sect1 id="kernel-conf">Configuring kernel network features

<p>FIXME: Content missing

<p>Many features of the kernel can be modified while running by
echoing something into the <file>/proc</file> file system or by using
<prgn>sysctl</prgn>. By entering <tt>/sbin/sysctl -A</tt> you can see
what you can configure and what the options are, and it can be
modified running <tt>/sbin/sysctl -w variable=value</tt> (see <manref
section="8" name="sysctl">). Only in rare cases do you need to edit
something here, but you can increase security that way as well. For
example:

<!-- FIXME: Should the prefix on all of these be /proc/sys/? era -->

<example>
net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1
</example>

<p>This is a <em>Windows emulator</em> because it acts like Windows on
broadcast ping if this option is set to 1. That is, ICMP_ECHO request
sent to the broadcast address will be ignored. Otherwise, it does
nothing.

<p>If you want to block any ICMP echo requests on your system, enable this
configuration option:

<example>
net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all = 0
</example>

<p>To log packets with impossible addresses (due to wrong routes) on your
network use:

<example>
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/log_martians = 1
</example>

<p>For more information on what things can be done with
<file>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/*</file> read
<file>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt</file>. All
the options are describe thoroughly under
<file>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt</file>
<footnote>In Debian the <package>kernel-image</package> package
installs the sources under <file>/usr/src/kernel-souce-2.X.X</file>,
just substitute <em>linux</em> to whatever kernel is
installed</footnote>.

<sect1 id="tcp-syncookies">Configuring Syncookies


<p>This option is a double-edged sword. On the one hand it protects
your system against syn flooding; on the other hand it violates
defined standards (RFCs).

<!-- What does this mean? (jfs)
This option is quite dumb as it floods the
other side like it floods you, so the other side is also busy. 
-->

<example>
net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies = 1
</example>

<p>If you want to change this option you each time the kernel is
working you need to change it in <tt>/etc/network/options</tt> by
setting <tt>syncookies=yes</tt>. This will take effect whener
<tt>/etc/init.d/networking</tt> is run (which is done at boot time)
whileas this will only work with the current running kernel:

<example>
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies 
</example>

<p>This option will only be available if the kernel is compiled with
the <tt>CONFIG_SYNCOOKIES</tt>. All Debian kernels are compiled with
this option builtin but you can verify it running:

<example>
$ sysctl -A |grep syncookies
net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies = 1
</example>

<p>For more information  on TCP syncookies read
<url id="http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html">.

<sect1 id="net-harden">Securing the network on boot-time

<p>When setting configuration options for the kernel networking you
need configure it so that it's loaded every time the system is

as well as other useful options.

<p><em>FIXME</em> Instead of providing this script provide a sample
configuration for <file>sysctl.conf</file> (see: <manref section="5"

<p>You can also create a <tt>init.d</tt> script and have it run on

<tt>rc.d</tt> links).

<sect1 id="kernel-fw">Configuring firewall features 

<p>In order to have firewall capabilities, either to protect the local
system or others <em>behind</em> it, the kernel needs to be compiled
with firewall capabilities. The standard Debian 2.2 kernel (also 2.2)
provides the packet filter <prgn>ipchains</prgn> firewall, Debian 3.0
standard kernel (kernel 2.4) provides the <em>stateful</em> packet
filter <prgn>iptables</prgn> (netfilter) firewall. Older Debian
distributions would need the appropriate kernel patch (Debian 2.1 uses
kernel 2.0.34).

<p>In any case, it is pretty easy to use a kernel different from the
one provided by Debian. You can find pre-compiled kernels as packages
you can easily install in the Debian system. You can also download the
kernel sources using the <package>kernel-source-X</package> and build
custom kernel packages using <package>make-kpkg</package>.

<p>Setting up firewalls in Debian is discussed more thoroughly in <ref
id="firewall-setup">.


<sect1 id="limit-bindaddr">Disabling weak-end hosts issues

<p>Systems with more than one interface on different networks
can have services configured so that they will bind only to 
a given IP address. This usually prevents services when requested
through a given address. However, this does not mean (although
it's a common misconception even I had) that the service is
bound to a given <em>hardware</em> address (interface card).
<footnote>
To reproduce this (example provided by Felix von Leitner on the
bugtraq mailing list):
<example>
   host a (eth0 connected to eth0 of host b):
     ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1
     ifconfig eth1 23.0.0.1
     tcpserver -RHl localhost 23.0.0.1 8000 echo fnord

   host b:
     ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.2
     route add 23.0.0.1 gw 10.0.0.1
     telnet 23.0.0.1 8000
</example>
<p>It seems, however, not to work with services bound to
127.0.0.1, you might need to write the tests using raw sockets.</p>
</footnote>

<p>This is not an ARP issue and it's not an RFC violation (it's 
called <em>weak end host</em> in 
<url id="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1122.txt" name="RFC1122">, 
section 3.3.4.2). 
Remember, IP addresses have nothing to do with physical interfaces.

<p>On 2.2 (and previous) kernels this can be fixed with:
<example>
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/hidden
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/hidden
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/hidden
.....
</example>
<p>On later kernels this can be fixed either with:
<list>
<item>iptables rules.
<item>properly configured routing.
<footnote>
The fact that this behaviour can be changed through routing
was described by Matthew G. Marsh in the bugtraq thread:
<example>
eth0 = 1.1.1.1/24
eth1 = 2.2.2.2/24

ip rule add from 1.1.1.1/32 dev lo table 1 prio 15000
ip rule add from 2.2.2.2/32 dev lo table 2 prio 16000

ip route add default dev eth0 table 1
ip route add default dev eth1 table 2
</example>
</footnote>
<item>kernel patching.
<footnote>
There are some patches available for this behaviour as
described in bugtraq's thread at
<url id="http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/~julian/#hidden">
and <url id="http://www.fefe.de/linux-eth-forwarding.diff">.
</footnote>
</list>
<p>Along this text there will be many ocasions in which it
is shown how to configure some services (sshd server, apache, printer
service...) in order to have them listening on any given
address, the reader should take into account that, without 
the fixes given here, the fix would not prevent accesses from 
within the same (local) network.
<footnote>
An attacker might have many problems pulling the access through
after configuring the IP-address binding if he is not on the same
broadcast domain (same network) as the attacked host. If the attack
goes through a router it might be quite difficult for the answers
to return somewhere.
</footnote>

<p>FIXME: comments on bugtraq indicate there is a Linux
specific method to bind to a given interface.

<p>FIXME: Submit a bug against netbase so that the routing fix
is standard behaviour in Debian?


<sect1>Protecting against ARP attacks

<p>When you don't trust the other boxes on your LAN (which should
always be the case, because it's the safest attitude) you should
protect yourself from the various existing ARP attacks.

<p>As you know the ARP protocol is used to link IP addresses to MAC
addresses.  (see <url name="RFC826"
id="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc826.txt"> for all the
details). Every time you send a packet to an IP address an arp
resolution is done (first by looking into the local ARP cache then if
the IP isn't present in the cache by broadcasting an arp query) to
find the target's hardware address.  All the ARP attacks aim to fool
your box into thinking that box B's IP address is associated to the
intruder's box's MAC address; Then every packet that you want to send
to the IP associated to box B will be send to the intruder's box...

<p>
Those Attacks (Cache poisonning, ARP spoofing...) allow the attacker
to sniff the traffic even on switched networks, to easily hijack
connections, to disconnect any host from the network... Arp attacks
are powerful and simple to implement, several tools exists : arpspoof
(present in package <package>dsniff</package>), <url name="arpmim"
id="http://www.team-teso.net/releases/arpmim-0.2.tar.gz">, <url
name="arpoison" id="http://web.syr.edu/~sabuer/arpoison/">...
<!-- ~sabuer broken and unavailable in the new web site provided -->

<p>However, there is always a solution:

<list>

<item>Use a static arp cache.  You can set up "static" entries in your
arp cache :

<example>
arp -s host_name hdwr_addr 
</example> 

<p>By setting static entries for each important host in your network
you ensure that nobody will create/modify a (fake) entry for these
hosts (static entries don't expire and can't be modified) and spoofed
arp replies will be ignored.


<item>Detect suspicious ARP traffic. You can use
<package>arpwatch</package>, <package>karpski</package> or more
general IDS that can also detect suspicious arp traffic
(<package>snort</package>, <url name="prelude"
id="http://www.mandrakelinux.com/prelude">...).

<item>Implement IP traffic filtering validating the the MAC address.
</list>


<sect id="snapshot">Taking a snapshot of the system

<p>Before putting the system into production system you culd take a
snapshot of the whole system. This snapshot could be used in the event
of a compromise (see <ref id="after-compromise">). You should remake
this upgrade whenever the system is upgraded, specially if you upgrade
to a new Debian release.

<p>For this you can use a writable removable-media that can be set up
read-only, this could be a floppy disk (read protected after use) or a
CD on a CD-ROM unit (you could use a rewriteable CD-ROM so you could
even keep backups of md5sums in different dates).

<p>The following script creates such a snapshot:

<example>
#!/bin/bash
/bin/mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
/bin/cp /usr/bin/md5sum /mnt/floppy
echo "Calculating md5 database"
>/mnt/floppy/md5checksums.txt
for dir in /bin/ /sbin/ /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/ /lib/ /usr/lib/
do
   find $dir -type f | xargs /usr/bin/md5sum >>/mnt/floppy/md5checksums-lib.txt
done
/bin/umount /dev/fd0
echo "post installation md5 database calculated"
</example>

<p>Note that the md5sum binary is placed on the floppy drive so it can
be used later on to check the binaries of the system (just in case it
gets trojaned). 

<p>The snapshot does not include the files under
<file>/var/lib/dpkg/info</file> which includes the md5 hashes of
installed packages (in files ended with <file>.md5sums</file>). You
could copy this information along too, however you should notice:

<list>
<item>the md5sums provided by the Debian packages include all the
files provided by them, which makes the database bigger (5 Mbs versus
600kbs in a Debian GNU/Linux system with graphical system and around
2.5 Gbs of software installed)

<item>not all Debian packages provide md5sums for the files installed
since it is not (currently) mandated policy.

</list>

<p>Once the snapshot is done you should make sure to set the medium
read-only. You can then store it for backup or place it in the drive
and use it to drive a <prgn>cron</prgn> check nightly comparing the original
md5sums against those on the snapshot.


<sect>Other recommendations
<sect1>Do not use software depending on svgalib

<p>
SVGAlib is very nice for console lovers like me, but in the past it
has been proven several times that it is very insecure. Exploits
against <prgn>zgv</prgn> were released, and it was simple to become
root. Try to prevent using SVGAlib programs wherever possible.  

<!-- FIXME: move this to policy section if there ever is one? -->
