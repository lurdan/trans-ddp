<chapt>Introduction
<p>
One of the hardest things about writing security documents is that every case
is unique. Two things you have to pay attention to are the threat environment
and the security needs of the individual site, host, or network. For instance,
the security needs of a home user are completely different from a network in a
bank. While the primary threat a home user needs to face is the script kiddie
type of cracker, a bank network has to worry about directed attacks. 
Additionally, the bank has to protect their customer's data with arithmetic 
precision. In short, every user has to consider the trade-off between
usability and security/paranoia.
<!-- Is this metaphor really appropriate? Sounds like rounding errors to me, 
era -->
<p>
Note that this manual only covers issues relating to software. 
The best software in the world can't protect you if someone can physically
access the machine. You can place it under your desk, or you can place
it in a hardened bunker with an army in front of it. Nevertheless the
desktop computer can be much more secure (from a software point of view)
than a physically protected one if the desktop is configured properly and
the software on the protected machine is full of security holes.
Obviously, you must consider both issues.

<p>This document just gives an overview of what you can do 
to increase the security of your Debian GNU/Linux
system. If you have read other documents regarding Linux security, you
will find that there are common issues which might overlap with this
document. However, this document does not try to be the ultimate source
of information you will be using, it only tries to adapt this same
information so that it is meaningful to a Debian GNU/Linux system.
Different distributions do some things in different ways (startup of
daemons is one example); here, you will find material which is
appropriate for Debian's procedures and tools.

any comments, additions or suggestions, and they will be

<p>This manual was started as a <em>HOWTO</em> by <url name="Alexander
Reelsen" id="mailto:ar@rhwd.de">. After it was published on the
Internet, <url name="Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña"
id="mailto:jfs@debian.org"> incorporated it into the <url name="Debian
Documentation Project" id="http://www.debian.org/doc">. A number of
people have contributed to these manual (all contributions are listed
in the changelog) but the following deserve special mention since they
have provided significant contributions (full sections, chapters or
appendices):

<sect>Where to get the manual (and available formats)
<p>
You can download or view the latest version of the Securing Debian
Manual from the <url name="Debian Documentation Project"
id="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/">. 
If you are reading a copy from another site, please check
the primary copy in case it provides new information. If you are reading
a translation, please review the version the translation refers to to
the latest version available. If you find that the version is behind
please consider using the original copy or review the
<ref id="changelog"> to see what has changed.

<!-- Note to translators: adjust the en.txt to XX.txt where XX is your 
     language code -->
<p>If you want a full copy of the manual you can either download the <url
id="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/securing-debian-howto.en.txt"
name="text version"> 
or the <url id="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/securing-debian-howto.en.pdf"
name="PDF version"> from the Debian Documentation's Project site. These versions might
be more useful if you intend to copy the document over to a portable device for
offline reading or you want to print it out. Be forewarned, the manual is over
two hundred pages long and some of the code fragments, due to the formatting
tools used, are not wrapped in the PDF version and might be printed incomplete.

<p>The document is also provided in text, html and PDF formats in the
<url id="http://packages.debian.org/harden-doc" name="harden-doc"> package
Notice, however, that the package maybe not be completely up to date with the
document provided on the Debian site (but you can always use the source
package to build an updated version yourself).

<p>You can also check out the changes introduced in the document by
reviewing its version control logs through its <url

<sect>Organizational Notes/Feedback
<p>
Now to the official part. At the moment I (Alexander Reelsen) wrote
most paragraphs of this manual, but in my opinion this should not stay
the case. I grew up and live with free software, it is part of my
everyday use and I guess yours, too. I encourage everybody to send me
feedback, hints, additions or any other suggestions you might have.

<p>
If you think, you can maintain a certain section or paragraph better,
then write to the document maintainer and you are welcome to do it.
Especially if you find a section marked as FIXME, that means the
authors did not have the time yet or the needed knowledge about the
topic, drop them a mail immediately.

<p>
The topic of this manual makes it quite clear that it is important to
keep it up to date, and you can do your part.  Please contribute.

<sect>Prior knowledge
<p>
The installation of Debian GNU/Linux is not very difficult and you
should have been able to install it. If you already have some
knowledge about Linux or other Unices and you are a bit familiar with
basic security, it will be easier to understand this manual, as this
document cannot explain every little detail of a feature (otherwise
this would have been a book instead of a manual). If you are not that
familiar, however, you might want to take a look at <ref
id="references"> for where to find more in-depth information.


<sect>Things that need to be written (FIXME/TODO)

<p>This section describes all the things that need to be fixed in this
manual. Some paragraphs include <em>FIXME</em> or <em>TODO</em> tags
describing what content is missing (or what kind of work needs to be
done). The purpose of this section is to describe all the things that
could be included in the future in the Manual, or enhancements that
need to be done (or would be interesting to add).

<p>If you feel you can provide help in contributing content fixing any
element of this list (or the inline annotations), contact the main
author (<ref id="authors">).


<list>

<item>Expand the incident response information, maybe add some ideas
derived from Red Hat's Security Guide's
<url id="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/security-guide/ch-response.html" name="chapter on incident response">.

<item>Write about remote monitoring tools (to check for system
availability) such as <package>monit</package>, <package>daemontools</package>
