<p>Below is a post-installation, step-by-step procedure for hardening
a Debian 2.2 GNU/Linux system. This is one possible approach to such a
procedure and is oriented toward the hardening of network services.
It is included to show the entire process you might use during
configuration. Also, see <ref id="checklist">.

<list>

<item>Install the system, taking into account the information
regarding partitioning included earlier in this document. After base
installation, go into custom install. Do not select task
packages. Select shadow passwords.

<item>Using <prgn>dselect</prgn>, remove all unneeded but selected
packages before doing [I]nstall. Keep the bare minimum of packages for
the system.

<item>Update all software from the latest packages available at
security.debian.org as explained previously in <ref
id="security-update">.

<item>Implement the suggestions presented in this manual regarding
user quotas, login definitions and <prgn>lilo</prgn>

<item>Make a list of services currently running on your system. Try:

<example>
  $ ps aux
  $ netstat -pn -l -A inet 
  # /usr/sbin/lsof -i | grep LISTEN
</example>

You will need to install <package>lsof-2.2</package> for the third
command to work (run it as root). You should be aware that
<prgn>lsof</prgn> can translate the word LISTEN to your locale
settings.

<item>In order to remove unnecessary services, first determine what
package provides the service and how it is started. This can be
accomplished by checking the program that listens in the socket. The
following shell script, which uses the programs <prgn>lsof</prgn> and
<prgn>dpkg</prgn>, does just that:

<example>
#!/bin/sh
# FIXME: this is quick and dirty; replace with a more robust script snippet
for i in `sudo lsof -i | grep LISTEN | cut -d " " -f 1 |sort -u` ; do
  pack=`dpkg -S $i |grep bin |cut -f 1 -d : | uniq`
  echo "Service $i is installed by $pack";
  init=`dpkg -L $pack |grep init.d/ `
  if [ ! -z "$init" ]; then
    echo "and is run by $init"
  fi
done
</example>

<item>Once you find any unwanted services, remove the associated
package (with <prgn>dpkg --purge</prgn>), or disable the service from
starting automatically at boot time using <prgn>update-rc.d</prgn>
(see <ref id="disableserv">).

<item>For inetd services (launched by the superdaemon), check which
services are enabled in <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file> using:

<example>
  $ grep -v "^#" /etc/inetd.conf | sort -u
</example>

Then disable those services that are not needed by commenting out the
line that includes them in <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file>, removing the
package, or using <prgn>update-inetd</prgn>.

<item>If you have wrapped services (those using
<prgn>/usr/sbin/tcpd</prgn>), check that the files
<file>/etc/hosts.allow</file> and <file>/etc/hosts.deny</file> are
configured according to your service policy.

<item>If the server uses more than one external interface, depending
on the service, you may want to limit the service to listen on a
specific interface. For example, if you want internal FTP access only,
make the FTP daemon listen only on your management interface, not on
all interfaces (i.e, 0.0.0.0:21).

<item>Re-boot the machine, or switch from single user user and then
back to multiuser using the commands:

<example>
  $ init 1
  (....)
  $ init 2
</example>

<item>Check the services now available, and, if necessary, repeat the
steps above.

<item>Now install the needed services, if you have not done so
already, and configure them properly.

<item>Use the following shell command to determine what user each
available service is running as:

<example>
  $ for i in `/usr/sbin/lsof -i |grep LISTEN |cut -d " " -f 1 |sort -u`; \
  > do user=`ps ef |grep $i |grep -v grep |cut -f 1 -d " "` ; \
  > echo "Service $i is running as user $user"; done
</example>

Consider changing these services to a specific user/group and maybe
<prgn>chroot</prgn>'ing them for increased security. You can do this by 
changing the <file>/etc/init.d</file> scripts which start the service. Most
services in Debian use <prgn>start-stop-daemon</prgn>, which has options 
(<tt>--change-uid</tt> and <tt>--chroot</tt>) for accomplishing this. A word
of warning regarding the <prgn>chroot</prgn>'ing of services: you may need to 
put all the files installed by the package (use dpkg -L) providing the 
service, as well as any packages it depends on, in the <prgn>chroot</prgn>'ed
environment. Information about setting up a <prgn>chroot</prgn> environment 
for the <prgn>ssh</prgn> program can be found in <ref id="chroot-ssh-env">.

<item>Repeat the steps above in order to check that only desired
services are running and that they are running as the desired
user/group combination.

<item>Test the installed services in order to see if they work as
expected.

<item>Check the system using a vulnerability assessment scanner (like
<package>nessus</package>), in order to determine vulnerabilities in
the system (i.e., misconfiguration, old services or unneeded
services).

<item>Install network and host intrusion measures like
<package>snort</package> and <package>logsentry</package>.

<item>Repeat the network scanner step and verify that the intrusion
detection systems are working correctly.

</list>

<p>For the truly paranoid, also consider the following:

<list>

<item>Add firewalling capabilities to the system, accepting incoming
connections only to offered services and limiting outgoing connections
only to those that are authorized.

<item>Re-check the installation with a new vulnerability assessment
using a network scanner.

<item>Using a network scanner, check outbound connections from the
system to an outside host and verify that unwanted connections do not
find their way out.

</list>

<p>FIXME: this procedure considers service hardening but not system
hardening at the user level, include information regarding checking
user permissions, SETUID files and freezing changes in the system
using the ext2 file system.

		    to send logs to this host (<file>/etc/syslog.conf</file>)
		    
		<item>Secure BIND, Sendmail, and other complex daemons
		    (run in a <prgn>chroot</prgn> jail; run as a non-root pseudo-user)

		<item>Install snort or a similar logging tool.
		    
		<item>Do without NIS and RPC if you can (disable portmap).
		    
	      </list>

	  <item>Policy issues
	      <list>
		
		<item>Educate users about the whys and hows of your policies.
		    When you have prohibited something which is regularly
		    available on other systems, provide documentation
		    which explains how to accomplish similar results using
		    other, more secure means.

		<item>Prohibit use of protocols which use clear-text passwords
		    (<prgn>telnet</prgn>, <prgn>rsh</prgn> and friends; ftp, imap, 
			http, ...).
		    
		<item>Prohibit programs which use SVGAlib.
		    
		<item>Use disk quotas.

	      </list>
	      
	  <item>Keep informed about security issues
	      <list>
		
		<item>Subscribe to security mailing lists
		    
		<item>Configure <package>apt</package> for security updates -- add to
		    <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> an entry (or
		    entries) for
		    http://security.debian.org/debian-security
		    
		<item>Also remember to periodically run
		<prgn>apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade</prgn>
		(perhaps install as a <prgn>cron</prgn> job?) as explained in <ref
		id="security-update">.

<appendix id="snort-box">Setting up a stand-alone IDS

<p>You can easily set up a dedicated Debian system as a stand-alone
Intrusion Detection System using <package>snort</package>.

<p>Some guidelines:

<list>

<item>Install a base Debian system and select no additional packages.

<item>Download and manually (with dpkg) install necessary packages
(see installed packages list below).

<item>Download and install ACID (Analysis Console for Intrusion
Databases).

</list>

<p>ACID is currently packaged for Debian as
<package>acidlab</package>. It provides a graphical WWW interface to
snort's output. It can also be downloaded from <url
id="http://www.cert.org/kb/acid/">, <url
id="http://acidlab.sourceforge.net"> or <url
id="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~rdanyliw/snort/">. You might also want
to read the <url
id="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Snort-Statistics-HOWTO/index.html"
name="Snort Statistics HOWTO">.

<p>This system should be set up with at least two interfaces: one
interface connected to a management LAN (for accessing the results and
maintaining the system), and one interface with no IP address attached
to the network segment being analyzed.

<p>The standard Debian <file>/etc/network/interfaces</file> file
normally used to configure network cards cannot be used, since the
<prgn>ifup</prgn> and <prgn>ifdown</prgn> programs expect an IP
address. Instead, simply use <tt>ifconfig eth0 up</tt>.

<p>Besides the base installation, <package>acidlab</package> also
depends on the packages <package>php4</package> and
<package>apache</package> among others. Download the following
packages (Note: the versions might vary depending on which Debian
distribution you are using, this list is from Debian <em>woody</em>

<appendix id="bridge-fw">Setting up a bridge firewall 

<p>This information was contributed by Francois Bayart in order to
help users set up a Linux bridge/firewall with the 2.4.x kernel and
<package>iptables</package>.
Kernel patches are no more needed as the code was made standard 
part of the Linux kernel distribution.
<!--
The only features needed are the bridge
firewall patch, available at <url name="sourceforge download page"
id="http://bridge.sourceforge.net/download.html">.

<p>For example, if you are using a 2.4.18 kernel, first install the
kernel source package, then download the <url name="patch"
id="http://bridge.sourceforge.net/devel/bridge-nf/bridge-nf-0.0.6-against-2.4.18.diff">
and apply it, as shown in this example:

<example>
Zipowz:/usr/src# apt-get install kernel-source-2.4.18
Zipowz:/usr/src# cd kernel-source-2.4.18
Zipowz:/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.18# patch -p1 < ../bridge-nf-0.0.6-against-2.4.18.diff 
patching file include/linux/netfilter.h
patching file include/linux/netfilter_ipv4.h
patching file include/linux/skbuff.h
patching file net/bridge/br.c
patching file net/bridge/br_forward.c
patching file net/bridge/br_input.c
patching file net/bridge/br_netfilter.c
patching file net/bridge/br_private.h

patching file net/Config.in
patching file net/core/netfilter.c
patching file net/core/skbuff.c
patching file net/ipv4/ip_output.c
patching file net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c
patching file net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_LOG.c
</example>-->

<p>To configure the kernel with necessary support, run
<tt>make menuconfig</tt> or <tt>make xconfig</tt>. In the section
<em>Networking options</em>, enable the following options:

<example>
[*] Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)
[ ]   Network packet filtering debugging (NEW)
<*> 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
[*]   netfilter (firewalling) support (NEW)
</example>

<p>Caution: you must disable this if you want to apply some
firewalling rules or else <prgn>iptables</prgn> will not work:

<example>
[ ]   Network packet filtering debugging (NEW)
</example>

<p>Next, add the correct options in the section <em>IP: Netfilter
Configuration</em>. Then, compile and install the kernel. If you want
to do it the <em>Debian way</em>, install
<package>kernel-package</package> and run <prgn>make-kpkg</prgn> to
create a custom Debian kernel package you can install on your server
using dpkg. Once the new kernel is compiled and installed, install the
<package>bridge-utils</package> package.

<p>Once these steps are complete, you can complete the configuration
of your bridge. The next section presents two different possible
configurations for the bridge, each with a hypothetical network map
and the necessary commands.

<sect>A bridge providing NAT and firewall capabilities

<p>The first configuration uses the bridge as a firewall with network
address translation (NAT) that protects a server and internal LAN
clients. A diagram of the network configuration is shown below:

<example>
Internet ---- router ( 62.3.3.25 ) ---- bridge (62.3.3.26 gw 62.3.3.25 / 192.168.0.1)
                                          |
                                          |
                                          |---- WWW Server (62.3.3.27 gw 62.3.3.25)
                                          |
                                          |
                                         LAN --- Zipowz (192.168.0.2 gw 192.168.0.1)
</example>

<p>The following commands show how this bridge can be configured.

<example>
# Create the interface br0
/usr/sbin/brctl addbr br0

# Add the Ethernet interface to use with the bridge
/usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth0
/usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth1

# Start up the Ethernet interface
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
/sbin/ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0

# Configure the bridge ethernet
# The bridge will be correct and invisible ( transparent firewall ).
# It's hidden in a traceroute and you keep your real gateway on the 
# other computers. Now if you want you can config a gateway on your 
# bridge and choose it as your new gateway for the other computers.

/sbin/ifconfig br0 62.3.3.26 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 62.3.3.32

# I have added this internal IP to create my NAT 
ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev br0
/sbin/route add default gw 62.3.3.25
</example>

<sect>A bridge providing firewall capabilities

<p>A second possible configuration is a system that is set up as a
transparent firewall for a LAN with a public IP address space.

<example>
Internet ---- router (62.3.3.25) ---- bridge (62.3.3.26)
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |---- WWW Server (62.3.3.28 gw 62.3.3.25)
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |---- Mail Server (62.3.3.27 gw 62.3.3.25)
</example>

<p>The following commands show how this bridge can be configured.

<example>
# Create the interface br0
/usr/sbin/brctl addbr br0

# Add the Ethernet interface to use with the bridge
/usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth0
/usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth1

# Start up the Ethernet interface
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
/sbin/ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0

# Configure the bridge Ethernet
# The bridge will be correct and invisible ( transparent firewall ).
# It's hidden in a traceroute and you keep your real gateway on the 
# other computers. Now if you want you can config a gateway on your
# bridge and choose it as your new gateway for the other computers.

/sbin/ifconfig br0 62.3.3.26 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 62.3.3.32
</example>

<p>If you traceroute the Linux Mail Server, you won't see the bridge.
If you want access to the bridge with <prgn>ssh</prgn>, you must have
a gateway or you must first connect to another server, such as the
"Mail Server", and then connect to the bridge through the internal
network card.</p>

<sect>Basic IPtables rules

<p>This is an example of the basic rules that could be used for either of these
setups.

<example>
iptables -F FORWARD
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -s 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -d 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -m state --state INVALID -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Some funny rules but not in a classic Iptables sorry ...
# Limit ICMP 
# iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp -m limit --limit 4/s -j ACCEPT
# Match string, a good simple method to block some VIRUS very quickly
# iptables -I FORWARD -j DROP -p tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 -m string --string "cmd.exe"

# Block all MySQL connection just to be sure
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 0/0 -d 62.3.3.0/24 --dport 3306 -j DROP

# Linux Mail Server Rules

# Allow FTP-DATA (20), FTP (21), SSH (22) 
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 62.3.3.27/32 --dport 20:22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow the Mail Server to connect to the outside
# Note: This is *not* needed for the previous connections 
# (remember: stateful filtering) and could be removed.
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 62.3.3.27/32 -d 0/0 -j ACCEPT

# WWW Server Rules

# Allow HTTP ( 80 ) connections with the WWW server
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 62.3.3.28/32 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# Allow HTTPS ( 443 ) connections with the WWW server
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 62.3.3.28/32 --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Allow the WWW server to go out
# Note: This is *not* needed for the previous connections 
# (remember: stateful filtering) and could be removed.
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 62.3.3.28/32 -d 0/0 -j ACCEPT

<appendix id="fw-security-update">Security update protected by a firewall

<p>After a standard installation, a system may still have some
security vulnerabilities. Unless you can download updates for the
vulnerable packages on another system (or you have mirrored
security.debian.org for local use), the system will have to be
connected to the Internet for the downloads.

<p>However, as soon as you connect to the Internet you are exposing
this system. If one of your local services is vulnerable, you might be
compromised even before the update is finished! This may seem paranoid
but, in fact, analysis from the <url id="http://www.honeynet.org"
name="Honeynet Project"> has shown that systems can be compromised in
less than three days, even if the system is not publicly known (i.e.,
not published in DNS records).

<p>When doing an update on a system not protected by an external
system like a firewall, it is possible to properly configure your
local firewall to restrict connections involving only the security
update itself. The example below shows how to set up such local
firewall capabilities, which allow connections from
security.debian.org only, logging all others.

<p>FIXME: add IP address for security.debian.org (since otherwise you
need DNS up to work) on /etc/hosts.

<p>FIXME: test this setup to see if it works properly

<p>FIXME: this will only work with HTTP URLs since ftp might need 
the ip_conntrack_ftp module, or use passive mode.

<appendix id="chroot-ssh-env"><Prgn>Chroot</Prgn> environment for <PRGN>SSH</PRGN>

<p>Creating a restricted environment for <PRGN>SSH</PRGN> is a tough job due 
to its dependencies and the fact that, unlike other servers, <PRGN>SSH</PRGN> 
provides a remote shell to users. Thus, you will also have to consider the
applications users will be allowed to use in the environment. If you create 
this file structure in, for example <file>/var/chroot/ssh</file>, you could 
start the <prgn>ssh</prgn> server <prgn>chroot</prgn>'ed with this command:

<example>
  # chroot /var/chroot/ssh /sbin/sshd -f /etc/sshd_config
</example>

<p>Notice, however, that in order for SSH to work the partition where the
chroot is setup cannot be mounted with the <em>nodev</em> option. If you use
that option, then you will get the following error: <em>PRNG is not seeded</em>,
because <file>/dev/urandom</file> does not work in the chroot.

<sect>Using <package>pam_chroot</package>

<p>Probably the easiest way is to use the <package>pam_chroot</package>
package provided in Debian. Once you install it you need to

<list>
<item>Modify <file>/etc/pam.d/ssh</file> to use this PAM module, add
as its last line:
<example>
session    required   pam_chroot.so
</example>

<item>set a proper chroot environment. You can either review
<file>/usr/share/doc/libpam-chroot/examples/</file>, use 
<package>makejail</package> or setup a minimum Debian environment with
<package>debootstrap</package>. Make sure the environment includes
the needed <file>/dev/ptmx</file> and <file>/dev/pty*</file> devices
and the <file>/dev/pts/</file> subdirectory (running MAKEDEV in the 
<file>/dev</file> directory of the chrooted environment should be sufficient).


<item>Configure <file>/etc/security/chroot.conf</file>
so that the users you determine are chrooted to the directory you setup
previously. You might want to have independent directories for 
different users so that they will not be able to see neither the whole 
system nor each other's.

<item>Configure SSH: If you are running a newer (post-3.4) version of 
OpenSSH that uses Privilege Separation you need to disable it:  
<example>
UsePrivilegeSeparation no
</example>
<p>Notice that this will lower the security of your system since the
OpenSSH server will then run as <em>root</em> user. 
This means that if a remote attack is found against OpenSSH an attacker
will get <em>root</em> privileges instead of <em>sshd</em>,
thus compromising the whole system.
<footnote>
If you are using a kernel that implements Mandatory Access Control
(RSBAC/SElinux) you can avoid changing this configuration just by
granting the <em>sshd</em> user privileges to make the chroot() system call.
</footnote>

</list>

<p>Note: This information is also available (and maybe more up
to date) in <file>/usr/share/doc/libpam-chroot/README.Debian.gz</file>,
please review it for updated information before taking the above steps.

<sect>Automatically making the environment (the easy way)

<p>You can easily create a restricted environment with the
<package>makejail</package> package, since it automatically takes care
of tracing the server daemon (with <prgn>strace</prgn>), and makes it
run under the restricted environment.

<p>The advantage of programs that automatically generate <prgn>chroot</prgn>
environments is that they are capable of copying any package to the
<prgn>chroot</prgn> environment (even following the package's dependencies and
making sure it's complete). Thus, providing user applications is easier.

<p>To set up the environment using <prgn>makejail</prgn>'s provided
examples, just use the command:

<example>
  # makejail /usr/share/doc/makejail/examples/sshd.py
</example>

<p>Read the sample file to see what other changes need to be made to
the environment. Some of these changes, such as copying user's home
directories, cannot be done automatically. Also, limit the exposure of
sensitive information by only copying the data from a given number of
users from the files <file>/etc/shadow</file> or
<file>/etc/group</file>.

<p>The following sample environment has been (slightly) tested and is
built with the configuration file provided in the package and includes
the <package>fileutils</package> package:

<sect>Patching <PRGN>SSH</PRGN> to enable <prgn>chroot</prgn> functionality

<p>Debian's <prgn>sshd</prgn> does not allow restriction of a user's movement 
through the server, since it lacks the <prgn>chroot</prgn> function that the 
commercial program <prgn>sshd2</prgn> includes (using 'ChrootGroups' or 
'ChrootUsers', see <manref name="sshd2_config" section="5">). However, there 
is a patch available to add this functionality available from 
<url id="http://chrootssh.sourceforge.net" name="ChrootSSH project"> 
(requested in <url id="http://bugs.debian.org/139047" name="Bug #139047">
in Debian).
The patch may be included in future releases of the OpenSSH package.
Emmanuel Lacour has <prgn>ssh</prgn> deb
packages for <em>sarge</em> with this feature. They are 
available at <url id="http://debian.home-dn.net/sarge/ssh/">. Notice that
those might not be up to date so completing the compilation step is recommended.

<p>A description of all the necessary steps can be found at <url
id="http://mail.incredimail.com/howto/openssh/"> (though it is aimed
at RedHat 7.2 users, almost all of them are applicable to
Debian). After applying the patch, modify <file>/etc/passwd</file> by
changing the home path of the users (with the special <tt>/./</tt>
token):

<example>
  joeuser:x:1099:1099:Joe Random User:/home/joe/./:/bin/bash
</example>

<p>This will restrict <em>both</em> remote shell access, as well as
remote copy through the <prgn>ssh</prgn> channel.

<p>Make sure to have all the needed binaries and libraries in the
<prgn>chroot</prgn>'ed path for users. These files should be owned by root to 
avoid tampering by the user (so as to exit the <prgn>chroot</prgn>'ed jailed). 
A sample might include:

<sect>Handmade environment (the hard way)

<p>It is possible to create an environment, using a trial-and-error
method, by monitoring the <prgn>sshd</prgn> server traces and log
files in order to determine the necessary files. The following
environment, contributed by José Luis Ledesma, is a sample listing of
files in a <prgn>chroot</prgn> environment for <prgn>ssh</prgn>:

<footnote>
Notice that there are no SETUID files. This makes it more difficult
for remote users to escape the <prgn>chroot</prgn>
environment. However, it also prevents users from changing their
passwords, since the <prgn>passwd</prgn> program cannot modify the
files <file>/etc/passwd</file> or <file>/etc/shadow</file>.

<appendix id="chroot-apache-env"><Prgn>Chroot</Prgn> environment for <PRGN>Apache</PRGN>

<sect>Introduction

<p>The <prgn>chroot</prgn> utility is often used to jail a daemon in a
restricted tree. You can use it to insulate services from one another,
so that security issues in a software package do not jeoparize the
whole server. When using the <prgn>makejail</prgn> script, setting up
and updating the chrooted tree is much easier.</p>

<p>FIXME: Apache can also be chrooted using 
<url id="http://www.modsecurity.org"> which is available in
<package>libapache-mod-security</package> (for Apache 1.x) and
<package>libapache2-mod-security</package> (for Apache 2.x).

<sect>Installing the server

<p>This procedure was tested on Debian GNU/Linux&nbsp;3.0 (Woody) with
<prgn>makejail</prgn> 0.0.4-1 (in Debian/testing).

<list>

<item> <p>Log in as <prgn>root</prgn> and create a new jail
directory:

<example>
$ mkdir -p /var/chroot/apache
</example>

 </item>

 <item> <p>Create a new user and a new group. The chrooted Apache
server will run as this user/group, which isn't used for anything else
on the system. In this example, both user and group are called
<prgn>chrapach</prgn>.

 <example> 
 $ adduser --home /var/chroot/apache --shell /bin/false \
 --no-create-home --system --group chrapach
 </example>

<p>FIXME: is a new user needed? (Apache already runs as the apache user)</p>

  </item>

  <item>Install Apache as usual on Debian: <tt>apt-get install
apache</tt></item>

<item>Set up Apache (e.g. define your subdomains, etc.). In the
<file>/etc/apache/httpd.conf</file> configuration file, set the
<em>Group</em> and <em>User</em> options to <tt>chrapach</tt>. Restart
Apache and make sure the server is working correctly. Now, stop the
Apache daemon.</item>

<item>Install <prgn>makejail</prgn> (available in Debian/testing for
now). You should also install <prgn>wget</prgn> and <prgn>lynx</prgn> as
they will be used by <prgn>makejail</prgn> to test the chrooted
server: <tt>apt-get install makejail wget lynx</tt></item>

<item>Copy the sample configuration file for Apache to the
<file>/etc/makejail</file> directory:
 <example> 
 # cp /usr/share/doc/makejail/examples/apache.py /etc/makejail/ 
 </example>

</item>
 
 <item>Edit <file>/etc/makejail/apache.py</file>. You need to change
the <em>chroot</em>, <em>users</em> and <em>groups</em> options. To
run this version of <prgn>makejail</prgn>, you can also added a
<prgn>packages</prgn> option. See the <url
id="http://www.floc.net/makejail/current/doc/" name="makejail
documentation">. A sample is shown here:

<example>
chroot=&quot;/var/chroot/apache&quot;
testCommandsInsideJail=[&quot;/usr/sbin/apachectl start&quot;]
processNames=[&quot;apache&quot;]
testCommandsOutsideJail=[&quot;wget -r --spider http://localhost/&quot;,
                         &quot;lynx --source https://localhost/&quot;]
preserve=[&quot;/var/www&quot;,
          &quot;/var/log/apache&quot;,
          &quot;/dev/log&quot;]
users=[&quot;chrapach&quot;]
groups=[&quot;chrapach&quot;]
packages=[&quot;apache&quot;, &quot;apache-common&quot;]
userFiles=[&quot;/etc/password&quot;,
           &quot;/etc/shadow&quot;]
groupFiles=[&quot;/etc/group&quot;,
            &quot;/etc/gshadow&quot;]
forceCopy=[&quot;/etc/hosts&quot;,
           &quot;/etc/mime.types&quot;]
</example>

<p><em>FIXME:</em> some options do not seem to work properly. For
instance, <file>/etc/shadow</file> and <file>/etc/gshadow</file> are
not copied, whereas <file>/etc/password</file> and
<file>/etc/group</file> are fully copied instead of being
filtered.</p>
 </item>
 
<item>Create the chroot tree: <tt>makejail /etc/makejail/apache.py</tt></item>

<item>If <file>/etc/password</file> and <file>/etc/group</file> were
fully copied, type:

      <example>
      $ grep chrapach /etc/passwd &gt; /var/chroot/apache/etc/passwd
      $ grep chrapach /etc/group &gt; /var/chroot/apache/etc/group
      </example>
to replace them with filtered copies.</item>

<item>Copy the Web site pages and the logs into the jail. These files
are not copied automatically (see the <em>preserve</em> option in
<prgn>makejail</prgn>'s configuration file).
      <example>
      # cp -Rp /var/www /var/chroot/apache/var
      # cp -Rp /var/log/apache/*.log /var/chroot/apache/var/log/apache
      </example>
  </item>

<item>Edit the startup script for the system logging daemon so that it
also listen to the <file>/var/chroot/apache/dev/log</file> socket. In
<file>/etc/init.d/sysklogd</file>, replace:
<tt>SYSLOGD=&quot;&quot;</tt> with <tt>SYSLOGD=&quot; -a
/var/chroot/apache/dev/log&quot;</tt> and restart the daemon
(<tt>/etc/init.d/sysklogd restart</tt>).</item>

  <item> Edit the Apache startup script (<file>/etc/init.d/apache</file>).
	You might need to make some changes to the default startup script for it
	to run properly with a chrooted tree. Such as:
    <list>
      <item>set a new <em>CHRDIR</em> variable at the top of the file;</item>
      <item>edit the <em>start</em>, <em>stop</em>, <em>reload</em>, 
        etc. sections;</item>
      <item>add a line to mount and unmount the <file>/proc</file>
filesystem within the jail.  </item>
    </list>
<example>
#! /bin/bash
#
# apache        Start the apache HTTP server.
#

    ;;

    echo -n "Stopping web server: $NAME"
    start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile "$CHRDIR/$PIDFILE" --oknodo
    umount /var/chroot/apache/proc

      --signal USR1 --startas $DAEMON --chroot $CHRDIR
    ;;

    echo -n "Reloading $NAME modules"
    start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile "$CHRDIR/$PIDFILE" --oknodo \
      --retry 30
    start-stop-daemon --start --pidfile $PIDFILE \
      --exec $DAEMON --chroot $CHRDIR
    ;;

  restart)
    $0 reload-modules
    exit $?
    ;;

  force-reload)
    $0 reload-modules
    exit $?
    ;;

  *)
    echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/$NAME {start|stop|reload|reload-modules|force-reload|restart}"
    exit 1
    ;;

if [ $? == 0 ]; then
  echo .

  exit 1
fi
</example>

      <p><em>FIXME</em>: should the first Apache process be run as
another user than root (i.e. add --chuid chrapach:chrapach)? Cons:
chrapach will need write access to the logs, which is awkward.</p>
  </item>

  <item>Replace in <file>/etc/logrotate.d/apache</file>
<tt>/var/log/apache/*.log</tt> with
<tt>/var/chroot/apache/var/log/apache/*.log</tt> </item>

  <item>Start Apache (<prgn>/etc/init.d/apache start</prgn>) and check
what is it reported in the jail log
(<file>/var/chroot/apache/var/log/apache/error.log</file>).  If your
setup is more complex, (e.g. if you also use PHP and MySQL), files will
probably be missing. if some files are not copied automatically by
<prgn>makejail</prgn>, you can list them in the <em>forceCopy</em> (to
copy files directly) or <em>packages</em> (to copy full packages and
their dependencies) option the <file>/etc/makejail/apache.py</file>
configuration file.  </item>

  <item> 
    <p>Type <tt>ps aux | grep apache</tt> to make sure Apache 
      is running. You should see something like:
      <example>
      root 180 0.0 1.1 2936 1436 ? S 04:03 0:00 /usr/sbin/apache
      chrapach 189 0.0 1.1 2960 1456 ? S 04:03 0:00 /usr/sbin/apache
      chrapach 190 0.0 1.1 2960 1456 ? S 04:03 0:00 /usr/sbin/apache
      chrapach 191 0.0 1.1 2960 1456 ? S 04:03 0:00 /usr/sbin/apache
      chrapach 192 0.0 1.1 2960 1456 ? S 04:03 0:00 /usr/sbin/apache
      chrapach 193 0.0 1.1 2960 1456 ? S 04:03 0:00 /usr/sbin/apache
      </example>
  </item>

  <item> Make sure the Apache processes are running chrooted by looking
in the <file>/proc</file> filesystem: <tt>ls -la
/proc/<var>process_number</var>/root/.</tt> where <var>process_number</var> is one
of the PID numbers listed above (2nd column; 189
    for instance). The entries for a restricted tree should be listed:
    <example>
    drwxr-sr-x 10 root staff 240 Dec 2 16:06 .
    drwxrwsr-x 4 root staff 72 Dec 2 08:07 ..
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 144 Dec 2 16:05 bin
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 120 Dec 3 04:03 dev
    drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 408 Dec 3 04:03 etc
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 800 Dec 2 16:06 lib
    dr-xr-xr-x 43 root root 0 Dec 3 05:03 proc
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 48 Dec 2 16:06 sbin
    drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 144 Dec 2 16:04 usr
    drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 168 Dec 2 16:06 var
    </example>
    <p>To automate this test, you can type:<tt>ls -la /proc/`cat
/var/chroot/apache/var/run/apache.pid`/root/.</tt></p>

    <p><em>FIXME</em>: Add other tests that can be run to make sure the
jail is closed?</p>
	</item>
</list>

<p>The reason I like this is because setting up the jail is not very
difficult and  the server can be updated in just two lines:

<example> 
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install apache
makejail /etc/makejail/apache.py
</example>
