<chapt>Debian Security Infrastructure

<sect id="debian-sec-team">The Debian Security Team

<p>Debian has a Security Team, made up of five members and two
secretaries who handle security in the <em>stable</em>
distribution. Handling security means they keep track of
vulnerabilities that arise in software (watching forums such as
bugtraq, or vuln-dev) and determine if the <em>stable</em>
distribution is affected by it.

<p>Also, the Debian Security Team, is the contact point for problems
that are coordinated by upstream developers or organizations such as
<url id="http://www.cert.org" name="CERT"> which might affect multiple
vendors. That is, when problems are not Debian-specific. There are two
contact points with the Security Team:

<list>

<item><url id="mailto:team@security.debian.org"
name="team@security.debian.org"> which only the members of the
security team read. 

<item><url id="mailto:security@debian.org" name="security@debian.org">
which is read by all Debian developers (including the security
team). Mails sent to this list are not published in the Internet (it's
not a public mailing list).

</list>

<p>Sensitive information should be sent to the first address and, in
some cases, should be encrypted with the Debian Security Contact key
(key ID 363CCD95).

<p>Once a probable problem is received by the Security Team it will
investigate if the <em>stable</em> distribution is affected and if it
is, a fix is made for the source code base. This fix will sometimes
include backporting the patch made upstream (which usually is some
versions ahead of the one distributed by Debian). After testing of the
fix is done, new packages are prepared and published in the <url
id="security.debian.org"> site so they can be retrieved through
<prgn>apt</prgn> (see <ref id="security-update">). At the same time a
<em>Debian Security Advisory</em> (DSA) is published on the web site
and sent to public mailing lists including <url
id="lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce"
name="debian-security-announce"> and bugtraq.

<p>Some other frequently asked questions on the Debian Security Team can be
found at <ref id="debian-sec-team-faq">.


<sect id="dsa">Debian Security Advisories

<p>Debian Security Advisories are made whenever a security
vulnerability is discovered that affects a Debian package. These
advisories, signed by one of the Security Team members, include
information of the versions affected as well as the location of the
updates and their MD5sums. This information is:

<list>
<item>version number for the fix.
<item>problem type.
<item>whether it is remote or locally exploitable.
<item>short description of the package.
<item>description of the problem.
<item>description of the exploit.
<item>description of the fix.
</list>


<p>DSAs are published both in <url id="http://www.debian.org/"
name="Debian's mainserver frontpage"> and in the <url
id="http://www.debian.org/security/" name="Debian security
pages">. Usually this does not happen until the website is rebuilt
(every four hours) so they might not be present immediately, the preferred
channel is the debian-security-announce mailing list.

<p>Interested users can, however (and this is done in some
Debian-related portals) use the RDF channel to download automatically
the DSAs to their desktop. Some applications, such as
<prgn>Evolution</prgn> (an email client and personal information
assistant) and <prgn>Multiticker</prgn> (a GNOME applet), can be used
to retrieve the advisories automatically. The RDF channel is available
at <url id="http://www.debian.org/security/dsa.rdf">.

<p>DSAs published on the website might be updated after being sent to
the public-mailing lists. A common update is adding cross references
to security vulnerability databases. Also, translations
<footnote>Translations are available in up to ten different
languages</footnote> of DSAs are not sent to the security mailing
lists but are directly included in the website.

<sect1 id="crossreference">Vulnerability cross references

<p>Debian provides a fully <url
id="http://www.debian.org/security/crossreferences"
name="crossreferenced table"> including all the references available
for all the advisories published since 1998. This table is provided to
complement the <url
id="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/refs/refmap/source-DEBIAN.html"
name="reference map available at CVE">. 

<P>You will notice that this table provide references to
security databases such as <url id="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid"
name="Bugtraq">,
<url id="http://www.cert.org/advisories/" name="CERT/CC Advisories">
and <url id="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls" name="US-CERT Vulnerability
Notes Database"> as well as CVE names (see below). These references
are provided for convenience use, but only CVE references are
periodically reviewed and included.  This feature was added to the
website on June 2002.

<p>One of the advantages of adding cross references to these
vulnerability databases is that:

<list>
<item>it makes Debian users easier to see and track which
general (published) advisories have already been covered by Debian. 

<item>system administrators can learn more of the vulnerability and
its impact by following the cross references.

<item>this information can be used to cross-check output from
vulnerability scanners that include references to CVE to remove false
positives (see <ref id="vulnasses-false-positive">).

</list>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="cve-compatible">CVE compatibility

<P>Debian Security Advisories were <url
id="http://www.debian.org/security/CVE-certificate.jpg" name="declared
CVE-Compatible"><footnote>The full <url
id="http://cve.mitre.org/compatible/phase2/SPI_Debian.html"
name="capability questionnaire"> is available at CVE</footnote> in
February 24, 2004.

<p>Debian developers understand the need to provide accurate and up to
date information of the security status of the Debian distribution,
allowing users to manage the risk associated with new security
vulnerabilities. CVE enables us to provide standardized references that
allow users to develop a <url
id="http://www.cve.mitre.org/compatible/enterprise.html"
name="CVE-enabled security management process">.

<p>The <url id="http://cve.mitre.org" name="Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE)"> project is maintained by the MITRE Corporation and
provides a list of standardized names for vulnerabilities and security
exposures.

<P>Debian believes that providing users with additional information
related to security issues that affect the Debian distribution is
extremely important. The inclusion of CVE names in advisories help
users associate generic vulnerabilities with specific Debian updates,
which reduces the time spent handling vulnerabilities that affect our
users. Also, it eases the management of security in an environment
where CVE-enabled security tools -such as network or host intrusion
detection systems, or vulnerability assessment tools- are already
deployed regardless of whether or not they are based on the Debian
distribution.

<p>Debian started adding CVE names to DSAs since June 2002, and now
provides CVE names for all DSAs released since September 1998 after a
review process started on August 2002. All of the advisories can be
retrieved on the Debian web site, and announcements related to new
vulnerabilities include CVE names if available at the time of their
release. Advisories associated with a given CVE name can be searched
directly through the <url id="http://search.debian.org/" name="search engine">.

<p>Users who want to search for a particular CVE name can use the web
search engine available in debian.org to retrieve advisories available
(in English and translated to other languages) associated with CVE
names. A search can be made for a specific name (like advisory <url
id="http://search.debian.org/?q=advisory+%22CAN-2002-0001%22&amp;ps=50&amp;o=1&amp;m=all"
name="CAN-2002-0001">) or for partial names (like all the 2002
candidates included in advisories search for <url
id="http://search.debian.org/?q=advisory+%22CAN-2002%22&amp;ps=50&amp;o=1&amp;m=all"
name="CAN-2002">). Notice that you need to enter the word advisory
together with the CVE name in order to retrieve only security
advisories.

<p>In some cases you might not find a given CVE name in published
advisories either because:

<list>
   <item> No Debian products are not affected by that vulnerability.
   <item> There is not yet an advisory covering that vulnerability
   (the security issue might have been reported as a <url
   id="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=security"
   name="security bug"> but a fix has not been tested and uploaded)
   <item> An advisory was published before a CVE name was assigned to a
   given vulnerability (look for an update at the web site)
</list>

<sect>Debian Security Build Infrastructure

<p>Since Debian is currently supported in a large number of
architectures, administrators sometimes wonder if a given architecture
might take more time to receive security updates than another. As a
matter of fact, except for rare circumstances, updates are available
to all architectures at the same time.

<p>While previously the task to build security updates was done by
hand, it is currently not (as Anthony Towns describes in 
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2002/debian-devel-announce-200206/msg00002.html" name="a mail">
sent to the debian-devel-announce mailing list dated 8th June
2002.)

<p>Packages uploaded by the security team (to <url
id="security.debian.org:/org/security.debian.org/queue/unchecked"> or
<url id="ftp://security.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue">)
with an appropriate patch are checked for signatures withing fifteen
minutes of being uploaded, once this is done they get added to the
list of the autobuilders (which no longer do a daily archive
run). Thus, packages can get automatically built for <em>all</em>
architectures thirty minutes or an hour or so after they're uploaded.
However, security updates are a little more different than normal
uploads sent by package maintainers since, in some cases, before being
published they need to wait until they can be tested further, an
advisory written, or need to wait for a week or more to avoid
publicizing the flaw until all vendors have had a reasonable chance to
fix it. 

<p>Thus, the security upload archive works with the following
procedure (called <em>"Accepted-Autobuilding"</em>):

<list>

<item>Someone finds a security problem.
     
<item>Someone fixes the problem, and makes an upload to
      security.debian.org's incoming (this <em>someone</em> is usually
      a Security Team member but can be also a package maintainer with
      an appropriate fix that has contacted the Security Team
      previously). The Changelog includes a <em>testing-security</em>
      or <em>stable-security</em> as target distribution.

<item>The upload gets checked and processed by a Debian system and moved
       into queue/accepted, and the buildds are notified. Files in here
       can be accessed by the security team and (somewhat indirectly) by 
       the buildds.

<item>Security-enabled buildds pick up the source package
       (prioritized over normal builds), build it, and send the logs to
       the security team.

<item>The security team reply to the logs, and the newly built
       packages are uploaded to queue/unchecked, where they're processed
       by a Debian system, and moved into queue/accepted.

<item>When the security team find the source package acceptable (i.e.,
       that it's been correctly built for all applicable architectures
       and that it fixes the security hole and doesn't introduce new
       problems of its own) they run a script which:

<list>
<item>installs the package into the security archive.

<item>updates the Packages, Sources and Release files of
security.debian.org in the usual way (<prgn>dpkg-scanpackages</prgn>,
<prgn>dpkg-scansources</prgn>...)

<item>sets up a template advisory that the security team can finish
off.

<item>(optionally) forwards the packages to the appropriate
proposed-updates so that it can be included in the real archive as
soon as possible.

</list>

</list>

<p>This procedure, previously done by hand, was tested and put through
during the freezing stage of Debian 3.0 woody (July 2002). Thanks to this
infrastructure the Security Team was able to have updated packages
ready for the apache and OpenSSH issues for all the supported (almost
twenty) architectures in less than a day.

<sect1>Developer's guide to security updates

<p>This mail was sent by Wichert Akkerman to the <url
id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2002/debian-devel-announce-200206/msg00004.html"
name="Debian-devel-announce mailing list"> in order to describe Debian
developer's behavior for handling security problems in their
packages. It is published here both for the benefit of developers as
well as for users to understand better how security is handled in Debian.

<p>Please note that the uptodate reference for this information is
the <url id="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/ch-pkgs#s-bug-security" name="Debian Developer's Reference">, this section will be
removed in the near future.

<sect2>Coordinating with the security team

<p>If a developer learns of a security problem, either in his package
or someone else's he should always contact the security team (at
team@security.debian.org). They keep track of outstanding security
problems, can help maintainers with security problems or fix them
themselves, are responsible for sending security advisories and
maintaining security.debian.org.

<p>Please note that security advisories are only done for release
distributions, not for testing, unstable (see <ref id="sec-unstable">)
or older distributions (see <ref id="sec-older">).

<sect2>Learning of security problems

<p>There are a few ways a developer can learn of a security problem:

<list>
<item>he notices it on a public forum (mailing list, website, etc.):
<item>someone files a bugreport (the <em>Security</em> tag should be
used, or added by the developer)
<item>someone informs him via private email.
</list>

<p>In the first two cases the information is public and it is important
to have a fix as soon as possible. In the last case however it might
not be public information. In that case there are a few possible options
for dealing with the problem:

<list>

<item>if it is a trivial problem (like insecure temporary files) there is no
  need to keep the problem a secret and a fix should be made and
  released.

<item>if the problem is severe (remote exploitable, possibility to gain root
  privileges) it is preferable to share the information with other
  vendors and coordinate a release. The security team keeps contacts
  with the various organizations and individuals and can take care of
  that.

</list>

<p>In all cases if the person who reports the problem asks to not
disclose the information that should be respected, with the obvious
exception of informing the security team (the developer should make
sure he tells the security team that the information cannot be
disclosed).

<p>Please note that if secrecy is needed the developer can also not
upload a fix to unstable (or anywhere else), since the changelog
information for unstable is public information.

<p>There are two reasons for releasing information even though secrecy
is requested/required: the problem has been known for too long, or
the information becomes public.

<sect2>Building a package

<p>The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. People are
relying on the exact behavior of a release once it is made, so any
change made to it can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true of libraries: the developer must make sure he never
changes the API or ABI, no matter how small the change.

<p>This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security
team might be able to help.

<p>In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for
example when large amounts of source code need to be modified or
rewritten. If that happens it might be necessary to move to a new
upstream version, but it should always be coordinated with the security team
beforehand.

<p>Related to this is another import aspect: developers must always
test your change. If there is an exploit the developer should try if
it indeed succeeds on the unpatched package and fails on the fixed
package. The developer should try normal usage as well, sometimes a
security fix can break normal use subtly.

<p>Finally a few technical things for developers to keep in mind:

<list>
<item>Make sure you target the right distribution in your debian/changelog.
  For stable this is stable-security and for testing this is
  testing-security. Do not target &lt;codename&gt;-proposed-updates.

<item>Make sure the version number is proper. It has to be higher than the
  current package, but lower than package versions in later
  distributions. For testing this means there has to be a higher version
  in unstable. If there is none yet (testing and unstable have the same
  version for example) upload a new version to unstable first.

<item>Do not make source-only uploads if your package has any binary-all
  packages. The buildd infrastructure will not build those.

<item>Make sure when compiling a package you compile on a clean system
  which only has package installed from the distribution you are
  building for. If you do not have such a system yourself you
  can try a debian.org machine (see http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi)
  or set up a chroot (the <package>pbuilder</package> and
  <package>debootstrap</package> packages can be helpful in that
  case).

</list>

<sect2>Uploading security fixes

<p>After the developer has created and tested the new package it needs to be
uploaded so it can be installed in the archives. For security uploads
the place to upload to is
ftp://security.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue/ .

<p>Once an upload to the security queue has been accepted the package will
automatically be rebuilt for all architectures and stored for
verification by the security team.

<p>Uploads waiting for acceptance or verification are only accessible by
the security team. This is necessary since there might be fixes for
security problems that cannot be disclosed yet.

<p>If a member of the security team accepts a package it will be installed
on security.debian.org as well as the proper &lt;codename&gt;-proposed-updates
in ftp-master or non-US archive.

<sect2>The security advisory

<p>Security advisories are written and posted by the security team. However
they certainly do not mind if a maintainer can supply (part of) the text
for them. Information that should be in an advisory is described in
<ref id="dsa">.

<sect id="deb-pack-sign">Package signing in Debian

<p>This section could also be titled "how to upgrade/update safely
your Debian GNU/Linux system" and it deserves its own section
basically because it is an important part of the Security
Infrastructure. Package signing is an important issue since it avoids
tampering of packages distributed in mirrors and of downloads with
man-in-the-middle attacks. Automatic software update is an important
feature but it's also important to remove security threats that could
help the distribution of trojans and the compromise of systems during
updates
<footnote>
<p>Some operating systems have already been plagued with
automatic-updates problems such as the
<url name="Mac OS X Software Update vulnerabity"
id="http://www.cunap.com/~hardingr/projects/osx/exploit.html">.
<p>FIXME: probably the Internet Explorer vulnerability handling
certificate chains has an impact on security updates on Microsoft Windows.
</footnote>.


<p>As of today (May 2005) Debian does not provide signed packages for
the distribution and the <em>woody</em> or <em>sarge</em> releases 
(3.0 or 3.1) do not integrate that
feature. There is a solution for signed packages which will
be, hopefully, provided in the next release (codename <em>etch</em>).
This new feature will be available in apt 0.6 (currently available
in the <em>experimental</em> distribution, see <ref id="apt-0.6">).

<p>This issue is better described in the
<url id="http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/strong_distro.html" name="Strong
Distribution HOWTO"> by V. Alex Brennen.

<sect1>The proposed scheme for package signature checks

<p>The current scheme for package signature checking
using <prgn>apt</prgn> is:

<list>
<item>the Release file includes the md5sum of Packages.gz 
(which contains the md5sums of packages) and will be signed.
The signature is one of a trusted source.

<item>This signed Release file is downloaded by 'apt-get update'
and stored along with Packages.gz.

<item>When a package is going to be installed, it is first downloaded,
then the md5sum is generated.

<item>The signed Release file is checked (signature ok) and it extracts from
it the md5sum for the Packages.gz file, the Packages.gz checksum is generated
and (if ok) the md5sum of the downloaded package is extracted from it.

<item>If the md5sum from the downloaded package is the same as the one in the
Packages.gz file the package will be 
installed otherwise the administrator will be alerted and the package will
be left in cache (so the administrator can decide whether to install it or not
). If the package is not in the Packages.gz and the administrator has 
configured the system to only install checked packages it will not be 
installed either.
</list>

<p>By following the chain of MD5 sums <prgn>apt</prgn> is capable of verifying
that a package originates from a a specific release. This is less
flexible than signing each package one by one, but can be combined with
that scheme too (see below).

<p>Currently, this scheme is <url
id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/debian-devel-200312/msg01986.html
" name="fully implemented"> in apt 0.6
for more information see <ref id="apt-0.6">. Packages that provide
a front-end to apt need to be modified to adapt to this new feature,
this is the case of <prgn>aptitude</prgn> which has been
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg02641.html"
name="modified"> to adapt to this scheme.

<p>Package signing has been discussed in Debian for quite some time, for
more information you can read:
<url id="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2001/8/"> and
<url id="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/11/">.

<sect1 id="check-releases">Checking distribution releases

<p>In case you want to add now the additional security checks and
don't want to run the experimental apt version (although we would
really appreciate testing of it) you can use the script below,
provided by Anthony Towns. This script can automatically do some new
security checks to allow the user to be sure that the software s/he's
downloading matches the software Debian's distributing.  This stops
Debian developers from hacking into someone's system without the
accountability provided by uploading to the main archive, or mirrors
mirroring something almost, but not quite like Debian, or mirrors
providing out of date copies of unstable with known security problems.

<p>This sample code, renamed as <prgn>apt-check-sigs</prgn>, should be 
used in the following way:
<example>
# apt-get update
# apt-check-sigs
(...results...)
# apt-get dist-upgrade
</example>

<p>First you need to:

<list>

<item>get the keys the archive software uses to to sign Release files,
<url id="http://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2003.asc"> and add them
to <file>~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg</file> (which is what
<prgn>gpgv</prgn> uses by default).
<example>
  gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --import ziyi_key_2003.asc
</example>

<item>remove any <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> lines that don't
 use the normal "dists" structure, or change the script so that it
 works with them.

<item>be prepared to ignore the fact that Debian security updates don't
have signed Release files, and that Sources files don't have
appropriate checksums in the Release file (yet).

<item>be prepared to check that the appropriate sources are signed by
the appropriate keys.

</list>

<p>This is the example code for <prgn>apt-check-sigs</prgn>, the
latest version can be retrieved from <url
id="http://people.debian.org/~ajt/apt-check-sigs">.
This code is currently in beta, for more information read
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200207/msg00421.html">.

<sect1>Alternative per-package signing scheme

<p>The additional scheme of signing each and every packages allows
packages to be checked when they are no longer referenced by an
existing Packages file, and also third-party packages where no
Packages ever existed for them can be also used in Debian but will not
be default scheme.

<p>This package signing scheme can be implemented using
<package>debsig-verify</package> and <package>debsigs</package>.
These two packages can sign and verify
embedded signatures in the .deb itself. Debian already has the
capability to do this now, but implementing the policy and tools 
won't be started until after woody releases.

<p>Latest dpkg versions (since 1.9.21) incorporate a 
<url
id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2001/debian-dpkg-200103/msg00024.html"
name="patch"> that provides this functionality as soon as 
<package>debsig-verify</package> is installed.

<p>NOTE: Currently <file>/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg</file> ships with
"no-debsig" as per default.

<p>NOTE2: Signatures from developers are currently stripped when they
enter off the package archive since the currently preferred method is
release checks as described previously.

<sect1 id="apt-0.6">Experimental apt packages

<p>The apt 0.6 release includes <em>apt-secure</em> which is a tool
that will allow a system administrator to test the integrity 
of the packages downloaded through the above scheme. 
This release includes the tool <prgn>apt-key</prgn> for adding 
new keys to apt's keyring, which by default includes only the current 
Debian archive signing key.

<p>If you want to test out this feature you need to add the experimental
distribution to your <file>sources.list</file> and run

<example>
# apt-get -t experimental install apt
</example>

<p>These changes are based on the
patch for <prgn>apt</prgn> (available in <url
id="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=203741" name="Bug
#203741">) which provides this implementation.  

<p>This feature is still under development, if you believe you find
bugs in this please make first sure you are using the latest version
(as this package might change quite a bit before it is finally
released) and, if running the latest version, submit a bug against the
<package>apt</package> package using the <em>experimental</em> tag.

<P>Notice that, when using this experimental apt version no extra
effort should be required on your part unless you use non-Debian
sources, in which case an extra confirmation step will be required by
apt-get. This is avoided by providing Release and Release.gpg files in
the non-Debian sources. The Release file can be generated with
<prgn>apt-ftparchive</prgn> (available in apt-utils 0.5.0 and later), 
the Release.gpg is just a detached signature. 
To generate both follow this simple procedure:

<example>
$ rm -f dists/unstable/Release
$ apt-ftparchive release dists/unstable > dists/unstable/Release
$ gpg --sign -ba -o dists/unstable/Release.gpg dists/unstable/Release
</example>
