<chapt id="intropdedian">Introducing &progeny-d;
<p>
This user guide is a touched-up debiandoc-sgml version of 
"Progeny Debian Manual".
<p>

<p>
&progeny-d; is a version of the Debian &gnu; /Linux operating
system. The CDs that come with this manual contain not only a
complete operating system, but also the tools for most computing
needs.
<p>
If you want an even larger selection of software, you can download it
for free from the<!-- Progeny web site (http://www.progeny.com/download)
or--> Debian web site (<url id="&debianhome;">).
<p>
This manual is designed to get started with &progeny-d;. It is
also designed for use in front of your computer.
<p>
The manual does not assume that you are an expert. However, it does
assume that you have used computers before, and want to transfer your
skills to Linux.
<p>
At the very least, you are assumed to be willing to learn. Linux
tools have come a long way in the last few years, but Linux is still
built with a do-it-yourself philosophy. While you can ignore this
philosophy, adapting it can bring a sense of power and control to
your computing.
<p>
If you master this manual, you will still not be an expert. To cover
Linux completely requires hundreds of pages. However, you will be
able to configure the basic parts of your system and be ready to
explore Linux on your own.


<sect id="lal">Learning About Linux
<p>
<url id="&linuxhome;" name="Linux"> is an operating system: a series of programs that let you
interact with your computer and run other programs.
<p>
Linux is modelled on the unix operating system. From the start, Linux
was designed to be a multi-tasking, multi-user system. These facts
are enough to make Linux different from other well-known operating
systems.
<p>
However, Linux is even more different than you might imagine. In
contrast to other operating systems, nobody owns Linux. Much of its
development is done by unpaid volunteers.
<p>
Development of what later became Linux began in 1984, when the &gnu;
Free Software Foundation (<url id="&gnuhome;">) began development of a free 
unix -like operating system. Linux's name is derived from that of
Linus Torvalds, who began development of a unix -like kernel in 1991.
<p>
While many groups and individuals have contributed to Linux, the
largest single contributor is still the Free Software Foundation,
which created not only most of the tools used in Linux, but also the
philosophy and the community that made Linux possible.
<p>
Linux is released under the &gnu; General Public License ( &gpl; ).
Unlike most software licenses, the &gpl; encourages users to freely
copy, change, and distribute source code.
<p>
For the Free Software Foundation, the emphasis of the &gpl; is on free
software as a philosophical right. The group that focuses on applying
the ideals in the &gpl; to business solutions is called the Open Source
movement. Its emphasis is on the faster development and higher
quality of software released under a public licence. However, to
outsiders, these differences are mainly a matter of emphasis.
<p>
Although the &gpl; is often said to encourage fragmentation, Linux
remains more or less standardized for several reasons.
<p>
First, final approval of changes to the kernel are overseen by Linus
Torvalds and his closest associates, especially Allan Cox.
<p>
Second, Linux is released in different versions or distributions.
Some distributions, like Debian, are volunteer efforts. Others, like
Progeny, are commercial. However, all programs are kept as compatible
as possible within the same distribution. Many programs also work
with other distributions, or can be made to work with a little
effort.
<p>
Third, volunteer software projects are usually coordinated by
informal project managers known as maintainers. Although anyone can
write improvements to a piece of software, the maintainer makes the
final decision about which improvements become an official part of
the project. Usually, the maintainer makes these decisions after
consulting the leading contributors to the project.
<p>
These mechanisms are loose enough that Linux users still have immense
freedom of choice in their software. For example, Linux users can
choose from a dozen different command line shells and several
graphical desktops. This selection is often bewildering to users of
other operating systems, who are not used to thinking of the command
line or desktop as something that they can change.
<p>
In addition to software selection, Linux is less likely to crash,
better able to run more than one program at the same time, and more
secure than many operating systems. With these advantages, Linux is
the fastest growing operating system in the server market. More
recently, Linux has begun to be popular among home and business users
as well.


<sect id="lad">Learning About Debian
<p>
<!--
Development at &progeny-l-s; builds on Debian &gnu; /Linux
(www.debian.org). 
-->
<url id="&debianhome;" name="Debian"> is a popular version of Linux. It is
developed by a decentralized team of over &num-ppl; volunteer programmers
in all parts of the world, and includes over &num-pkg; software packages.
<p>
Debian was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock, now president and CEO of
Progeny which funded and created the previous version of this "&book-title;".
The name of Debian combines Ian's name with that of his wife
Debra. Its full name, Debian &gnu; /Linux, recognizes the central role
of the GNU Free Software Foundation in developing Linux.
<p>
Debian has been a major force in the rise of Linux and Open Source
software over the last seven years. In fact, the Debian Free Software
guidelines became the main source of the Open Source Definition in
<!-- FIXME: something! -->

Although Debian has been almost entirely non-commercial, it is
one of the most popular distributions of Linux. It is also the basis
for several commercial distributions, including Progeny.
<p>
Debian is especially popular among advanced users because of its
technical excellence and its deep commitment to the needs and
expectations of the Linux community. Debian also introduced many
features to Linux that are now commonplace.
<p>
For example, Debian was the first Linux distribution to include a
package management system for easy installation and removal of
software. It was also the first Linux distribution that could be
upgraded without requiring reinstallation.
<p>
Debian continues to be a leader in Linux development. Its apt program
is second to none for managing software over the Internet. Moreover,
its development process is an example of just how well the Open
Source development model can work - even for very complex tasks such
as building and maintaining a complete operating system.
<p>
<sect id="lapd">Learning About Progeny Debian
<p>
&progeny-warning;
<p>
May put list of present and past Debian based distributions here.
<p>
Progeny Debian is not a distribution spun off from Debian in the
sense that Mandrake is based on Red Hat. Progeny's efforts are
contributions to Debian, not a replacement for it. In fact, many
Progeny employees are (or have been) actively involved with Debian.
<p>
One of Progeny Debian main goals is to bring ease of use and system
integration enhancements to Debian without taking away the
flexibility and power of the underlying Debian system. The areas that
Progeny is working in include installation, system administration,
hardware detection, and software management.
<p>
Another goal is to apply an additional testing and release cycle to
the general Debian development cycle. Progeny hopes that this effort
will help Debian provide its users with more frequent current and
stable releases.
<p>
So far as possible, Progeny works with existing free software, and
with existing Debian development efforts. As with Debian, all of
&progeny-d;'s development occurs in an open forum. Everyone is
welcome and encouraged to participate.
<p>
To get involved in Progeny's Debian development efforts, subscribe to
the progeny-debian mailing list. Send an e-mail to
progeny-debian-request@lists.progeny.com with the word subscribe in
the subject line or message body.

<sect id="cuitm">Conventions Used in This Manual
<p>
To help you concentrate on learning, this manual uses as few
conventions as possible. In fact, it has only three:
<p>
<list>
<item> When you have to choose an icon or menu item with the mouse, you
    may be told to "select" or to "click" or "click on." All these
    instructions mean that you should select an item with the cursor
    while depressing the left mouse button.
<p>   
    Similarly, "right click" means to use the right mouse button,
    while, "middle click" means to use the middle mouse button or the
    equivalent.

<!-- XXX FIXME XXX: Type-set should be debiandoc-sgml compatible -->
<!--
        document conventions:
          file,directory,device == file (full path)
          program, command == prgn
          variable == var
          package == package
          program output == tt
          key input == em, example for longer ones
          command input == tt
-->
 
<item> Information to type appears in a <!--sans serif--> 
    <tt>fixed width font text</tt>, like this: <tt>chmod 777 todo.txt</tt> . 
<p>
    Punctuation after this text should not be typed.

<item><var>Italics text</var> indicates variable information.
    For example, the standard format for a command is:
<p>
    <var>command options argument files</var>
<p>   
    The <!--small capitals--> italics indicate that any command can replace the word
    "command" any options the word "options" and so on.
</list>
<p>
Following are proposed conventions by "Osamu".
<list>
<item>PRGN: <prgn>program-name</prgn>
<item>FILE: <file>/full/path/name/to/file</file> <file>/directory</file>
<item>PACKAGE: <package>package-name</package>
<item>TT: <tt>short command input and console output</tt>
<item>EXAMPLE: <example># root-command -option</example>
<example>
$ shell-user-command -option <var>variable-argument</var>
</example>
<item>Use punctuation outside of "quotation".  This is not right English but clear manual contents.
<item>Convert "Type command -option ." into shell console screen:
<example>
$ command -option
</example>
</list>
<p>
&note-png;
<p>
Whenever files are a variable, you can also use a directory name.
<p>
&note-png;
<p>
Variable information may include source and target. The source is the
file that original information is taken from. The target is the file
that is acted upon.
<p>
For example, when a file is copied, the source is the file being
copied, and the target is the new copy that is created.


<sect id="fywl">Familiarizing Yourself with Linux
<p>
This manual introduces concepts as you are likely to need them. For
now, here are some concepts that may be new to you:
<p>
<list>
<item> Linux generally uses a three-button mouse. If you do not have a
    middle mouse button, you can emulate three buttons by clicking
    the left and the right mouse buttons at the same time.
<item> The command line is much more flexible than you might think. It
    includes the abilities to cut and paste, to re-use previous
    commands, and to complete what you have typed in with a command.
<item> For greater security, Linux makes strict use of accounts. Unlike
    some operating systems, you cannot bypass logging in to the
    system by pressing the Enter key. Most users have only limited
    access to files. Typically, only the root user (also called the
    super user or system administrator) has access to all files.
<item> Linux has a consistent system for naming hardware, but the system
    is different from that of other popular operating systems. You
    should know the Linux naming system to avoid accidentally
    over-writing information.
<item> Linux's directory system is similar to unix 's. Knowing the
    structure can help you find files.
<item> Debian includes several boot managers.
    <list>
      <item><package>lilo</package>: classic general purpose boot manager.
      <item><prgn>grub</prgn>: new improved general purpose boot manager.
      <item><package>syslinux</package>: for making boot floppy on DOS FAT system.
      <item><package>loadlin</package>: boot Linux from DOS.
      <item><package>mbr</package>: replacement for the DOS master boot loader.
    </list>
    With a boot manager, you can use more than one operating system on the same
    computer. <!-- this entry modified by Osamu -->
<item> Many Linux system settings can be changed by editing a
    configuration file in a text editor.
    <list>
    <item><package>nano</package>
    <item><package>vim</package>   
    <item><package>emacs</package>
    <item> ...
    </list>
<item> Linux provides services such as printing through a number of
    independent programs or processes.
<item> Processes that start with your machine and run in the background
    until you need them are called daemons.
</list>
<p>
At first, these differences may seem overwhelming. Take your time and
learn them as the need arises. Once you have learned them, you will
find that the features of Linux give you more convenience,
efficiency, and hands-on control than other popular operating
systems.
