<chapt id="ctsystem">Configuring the System
<p>
&progeny-d; automatically configures your system during
installation. However, you may need to use other configuration
methods if:
<p>
<list>
<item> Your system works, but some settings can be improved.
<item> Your system works, but you want to lower the settings to save
    system resources or improve speed.
<item> You want to make adjustments based on personal preferences.
<item> A device is not detected.
</list>
<p>
This chapter explains how to set up basic hardware, as well as many
parts of your everyday working environment. It covers:
<p>
<list>
<item> Hardware.
<item> Partitions.
<item> Networks and internet connections
<item> Graphical displays.
<item> Other settings you might want to customize.
</list>


<sect id="ucm">Understanding Configuration Methods
<p>
Linux includes dozens of configuration tools, from command line
utilities that ask you questions to graphical interfaces. However,
the most common in &progeny-d; are:
<p>
<list>
<item> dpkg-reconfigure , which configures using simple question and
    answer dialogues. Two useful tools are etherconf and pppconf .
<item> The System tools in the gnome Control Center. These are similar
    to the tools that you used during installation.
<item> Text editors for manual editing of configuration files. This
    method requires exact knowledge, but allows complex configuration
    and is always available so long as you have a text editor. For
    expert users, this is often the tool of choice.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
Hardware connected with the graphical display including the monitor,
video card, and pointer can be configured by editing the profiles in
the /etc/X11/Xf86Config-4 file. In each section of the file, the
first profile is used by default.
<p>
<list>
<item> The kernel, which can be customized and recompiled. This method
    requires exact knowledge, and can be intimidating to new users.
    However, it may be necessary, especially if hardware is
    undetected.
</list>


<sect1 id="utss">Understanding the System Settings
<p>
&progeny-d; includes the tools used to configure during the
install as part of the gnome Control Center.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Do one of the following:
<item> From the panel, select the Control Center icon from the panel.
<item> From the menu, select Settings &gt; System.
<item> From the menu, select Programs &gt; Settings &gt; System.
<item> 2 Select the configuration tool to use. Choice are:
<item> Date and Time.
<item> Electronic Mail.
<item> Network.
<item> Printer.
<item> X Configuration (Display).
</list>


<sect1 id="umc">Understanding Manual Configuration
<p>
Most configuration files are found in the /etc/ directory.
Configuration file can be changed in a text editor.
<p>
Dozens of text editors are available, but you should learn either a
variant of vi or emacs . At least one of these editors should be
available on any Linux system. By default, &progeny-d; uses vim ("
vi improved") editor.
<p>
Manual configuration is especially useful if you are using
single-user mode, or do not have the X Window System running.
<p>
For more information on your preferred text editor, see its on-line
help.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Prepare an emergency disk if you do not already have one.
<item> 2 Log in as root.
<item> 3 Make an extra copy of the file you are editing.
<item> 4 Edit and save the file in a text editor.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
As an extra precaution, write down the changes you have made.
<p>
<list>
<item> 5 In some cases, you may have to restart the X Window System or
    your computer for the changes to take effect.
</list>


<sect2 id="rfewmr">Recovering from Errors While Manually Reconfiguring
<p>
If changing settings may make your system unusable, you can recover
by following these steps:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Start your machine with a boot disk or select single-user mode
    from the boot manager.
<item> 2 Type: cp -f backup file .
   
    The backup the configuration file overwrites the damaged file.
   
<item> 3 Restart your system. The damage to your system is now repaired.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
If you wrote down the changes you made, you can also edit the
configuration file in a text editor.


<sect2 id="utvte">Using the vim Text Editor
<p>
The vim editor is an enhanced version of vi, one of the standard text
editors. Like vi, vim has two modes:
<p>
<list>
<item> Command mode: For entering keyboard commands about the program or
    the file being edited.
<item> Insert mode: For editing a file.
</list>
<p>
Type vim to start. To open vim with a file, type vim file.
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
Using these two modes may be confusing if you are unfamiliar with
them, so practice using vim enough so that you are comfortable enough
to use it in an emergency.

<sect1 id="rak">Recompiling a Kernel
<p>
The Linux kernel contains the drivers for hardware, filesystems, and
other features of the operating system. Since each piece of hardware
or feature has its own module, you can make your operating system
quicker and more efficient by only loading support for what is
actually on your system.
<p>
You may need to reconfigure the kernel when you add or remove
hardware or other features. You can also temporarily enable a module,
with the modprobe command. However, if you reboot the system, you
will need to use the command again.
<p>
Making permanent changes to the kernel consists of three steps:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Editing the kernel.
<item> 2 Building or compiling the kernel.
<item> 3 Installing the kernel.
</list>
<p>
However, before configuring the kernel, you should gather information
about the present configuration, and prepare carefully so that you
can recover from accidents.


<sect2 id="fkami">Finding Kernel and Module Information
<p>
<list>
<item> For a list of currently loaded kernel modules, type: modprobe -l
<item> To see the version of the kernel you are currently using, type: 
    uname -r .
</list>


<sect2 id="ptbak">Preparing to Build a Kernel
<p>
<list>
<item> Prepare a usable rescue disk. If the kernel does not work after
    you build it, the rescue disk gives you a way to start your
    system and correct the problem. See <ref id="mabrd">.
<item> Make a copy of your current kernel and give it a different name.
    Usually, your kernel is /boot/vmlinuz*. The kernel number usually
    follows the file name - for example, vmlinuz-2.2.18 or 
    vmlinuz-2.4.2.
   
    If you are unsure of your kernel's name, check the boot manager
    entries.
   
<item> Add a stanza for your newly-named current kernel to the boot
    manager. By adding this entry, you ensure that you can start your
    system if the kernel does not work after you build it. See
    <ref id="ctbl">.
<item> Gather information about any hardware whose settings you are
    enabling or changing. Use the manuals, the system's bios
    settings, and Linux's information commands to find the
    information you need. See <ref id="rsi">.
</list>


<sect2 id="smodules">Selecting Modules
<p>
The first step in configuring the kernel is to select the modules to
enable:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 While logged in as root user, type cd /usr/src/linux .
<item> 2 Open one of the kernel editing tools:
<item> make menuconfig : a command line tool with a basic interface.
<item> make xconfig : a desktop tool.
   
    The easiest tool to use is xconfig . However, it is not always
    current.
   

&note-png;
<p>
</list>
To use one of these tools, unarchive /usr/src/kernel-source-2.2.18.
tar.bz2.
<p>
<list>
<item> 3 Follow the on-screen instructions to edit the kernel. Refer to
    the information you gathered beforehand as necessary.
<item> 4 Exit the editing tool. The file /usr/src/linux/.config is
    created. It contains a list of your selections that is used to
    build the kernel.
</list>


<sect2 id="btk">Building the Kernel
<p>
Building or compiling the kernel is the second step in configuring
the kernel.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Select the modules to enable. See <ref id="smodules">.
<item> 2 Regenerate dependency files. Type: make dep clean .
<item> 3 Create the kernel image. Depending on whether you want the file
    is compressed using gzip or bzip2, type either make zImage or 
    make bzImage .
   
    The file /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage (or bzImage) is
    created.
   
    The name of the directory below /arch may change, depending on
    what processor you enabled in the kernel.
   
<item> 4 Build and install modules. Type: make modules modules_install .
   
    This string includes two commands, make modules and make
    modules_install.
   

&note-png;
<p>
</list>
You can install automate kernel building by installing the package
called kernel-package .
<p>
Once it is installed, you only need to type: make -kpkg kernel_image


<sect2 id="iak">Installing a Kernel
<p>
Installing a kernel is third step in configuring a kernel.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Build the kernel. See <ref id="btk">.
<item> 2 Move zImage (or bzImage) to the root partition, renaming it.
    The /boot directory is the conventional location.
<p>   
    Traditionally, the kernel is vmlinuz .
<p>   
    If you have several versions of a kernel, add a suffix
    identifying the kernel version or some unique aspect of the
    kernel.
<p>   
    For instance, if only one kernel has scsi support, you could name
    it vmlinuz-scsi .
   
<item> 3 If necessary, add the new kernel to the boot manager. See
    <ref id="ctbl">.
<item> 4 Create a new boot disk. See <ref id="mabrd">.
</list>
<p>
You can now start your system with the new kernel by selecting it
from the boot manager when you start your computer.
<p>
If you have any problems, you can use the older kernel to start your
system.


<sect id="chardware">Configuring Hardware
<p>
Linux hardware support is rapidly improving. However, Linux still
cannot run as much hardware as some popular operating systems.
<p>
Before buying hardware for your Progeny Linux System, check that it
runs under Linux. If the hardware is supported, &progeny-d; should
generally detect it once it is added.
<p>
As a general rule, if Linux supports your scsi controller card, then
you should be able to use any scsi software, including scanners, cd
drives, and removable drives, including Iomega Bernoulli and Zip
drives, and Syquest drives.
<p>
Support for ide hardware is more varied. In some cases, you need to
install a driver or recompile the kernel before an ide device is
usable.
<p>
usb support is just starting to become commonplace for Linux. For
this reason, check compatibility before purchasing new software.
<p>
You can check the support for a particular piece of hardware by:
<p>
<list>
<item> Contacting the manufacturer.
<item> Doing an internet search on the manufacturer and model. Look for
    hardware compatibility lists, how-tos, and discussion groups in
    which people describe their experiences.
<item> Contacting &progeny-l-s; or posting to the &progeny-d;
    mailing lists.
</list>
<p>
Once you add the hardware to your system, it should generally be
detected automatically. However, in some cases, you may need to
configure it.
<p>
This section outlines some of the more common hardware issues:
<p>
<list>
<item> Configuring a printer.
<item> Configuring a sound card.
<item> Setting up Palm synchronization.
<item> Setting up a scanner.
</list>


<sect1 id="caprinter">Configuring a Printer
<p>

<url id="img/System-2.png">
<p>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
Because of the complexities of the Linux printing system manual
configuration of printers is recommended only for experienced users.
<p>
In particular, because &progeny-d; uses magicfilter , direct
editing of the /etc/printcap file could cause problems.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Select Systems &gt; Printer from the gnome Control Center.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
If you are using the kde desktop, type /usr/bin/
printer-configlet-capplet at a command line.
<p>
<list>
<item> 2 Select the Printer definition to create or edit. If you have
    not created a Printer definition already, you can only select
    New.
<item> 3 Enter a short name and a long name for the printer definition.
    These names can help you identify the printer.
   
    The short name appears on the printer spool,which stores files
    before they are sent to the printer, and in configuration files.
    The long name is used mainly to help you identify the printer.
   
    At some companies, printers are named with a theme, such as
    animals or famous people.
   
    However, names based on some combination of the manufacturer,
    model, and or path name of the printer may be easier to work
    with.
   
<item> 4 Select the location of the printer:
<item> Local: the printer is attached to the machine on which you are
    installing. You need to enter the device to which the local
    printer is attached. Usually, the device will be the first
    parallel port, /dev/lp0.
<item> Remote: The printer is on a network to which your machine is
    attached. You need to enter:
<item> The hostname: The machine to which the printer is attached.
<item> The printer name: The name of the printer on the system to which
    it is attached.
   
    If you do not have this information, consult your system
    administrator.
   
<item> 5 Select the printer driver from the list. Printers are listed by
    manufacturer, then by model.
   
    If your printer is not listed, it may be able to emulate one that
    is. Hewlett-Packard Laserjet drivers for both postscript and
    non-postscript printers work for many other makes and models of
    printers.
   
<item> 6 Select the Apply button to enter the printer definition.
<item> 7 Select the default printer. If you entered only one printer
    definition in the previous screen, then it is already listed as
    default.
<item> 8 Select the default paper size. If you are North American, you
    can use the default Letter. If not, you probably want A4.
</list>


<sect1 id="casc">Configuring a Sound Card
<p>
&progeny-d; detects most sound cards automatically. However, in
some cases, you may need to configure sound support in the kernel. 
See <ref id="rak">.
<p>
Before editing the kernel, you need to know your card's:
<p>
<list>
<item> irq numbers.
<item> dma channels.
<item> Port addresses.
</list>
<p>
If your card is already installed, you can find information about it:
<p>
<list>
<item> In /proc/sound.
<item> The computer's bios settings.
<item> The sound card's manual, which may list defaults.
<item> From the tools of another operating system on which the card is
    already installed.
</list>


<sect2 id="ipaps">Installing Plug and Play Sound Cards
<p>
Instead of configuring the kernel, you can use a command tool to
enable cards that support the Plug and Play standard:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Type: pnpdump&gt; /etc/isanp.conf .
<item> 2 Open isapnp.conf in a text editor.
<item> 3 Uncomment the settings you want to try. Remove the hash marks
    (#) from the lines on which the settings are listed.
<item> 4 Save the file, and then reboot your system.
<item> 5 To check whether sound is enabled, start a program that uses
    sound. If you have none, enable sound for the desktop in the
    Control Center.
</list>


<sect1 id="supid">Setting Up Personal Information Devices
<p>
&progeny-d; is not installed with support for personal information
devicess. However, you can add this support by installing some
packages.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Install the cradle for the device. Follow the instructions that
    accompany it.
<item> 2 If the device is connected to a serial port, add the user
    account from which the device is to be used to the dialout group.
    Type: adduser user dialout .
<item> 3 Install the pilot-link and pilot-link-perl packages. See
    <ref id="iraus">.
<item> 4 Install synchronization packages. Many are available,
    including:
<item> pilot-manager : A basic synchronization package.
<item> gnome-pilot and gnome-pilot-conduits : Synchronization packages
    for the gnome desktop. They are accessible from the gnome Control
    Center under Peripherals. You must setup gnome-pilot before using
    any of the conduits.
<item> jpilot : A synchronization tool not specific to a desktop.
<item> 5 Continue by following the instructions included with the
    packages you install.
</list>


<sect1 id="suas">Setting Up a Scanner
<p>
&progeny-d; is not installed with the software needed for
scanners. However, you can add support by installing one of several
packages. Linux supports most scsi scanners. More recently, support
for many usb scanners is also available.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Install the scanner. Follow the instructions that accompany it.
<item> 2 Install one of the following packages:
<item> sane : A basic set of utilities for use with scanners.
<item> sane-gimp : A set of scanner utilities that can be run separately
    or used within the gimp , the graphics tool included in most
    Linux distributions.
<item> xsane : An alternative set of utilities for scanners.
<item> xsane-gimp : An alternative set of scanner utilities that can be
    run separately or used within the gimp , the graphics tool
    included in most Linux distributions.
   
    See <ref id="iraus">.
   

&note-png;
<p>
</list>
To run the gimp , right-click on the workspace, then select New &gt; The
gimp .
<p>
<list>
<item> 3 Continue by following the instructions that come with the
    package
</list>


<sect id="cpartitions">Configuring Partitions
<p>
Linux users often spend more time configuring partitions than the
users of other operating systems. Many users prefer to mount
important directories on different partitions, either to control the
space used by certain files, or to make recovery from disaster
easier.
<p>
Even more have multiple operating systems on the same machine, and
not only have to divide their hard drives into more partitions, but
also need to use a boot loader to select a operating system when
their computers start.
<p>
This section covers:
<p>
<list>
<item> Partitioning a hard drive.
<item> Mounting and unmounting partitions.
<item> Creating swap partitions.
<item> Configuring the boot loader.
</list>


<sect1 id="pahd">Partitioning a Hard Drive
<p>
The fdisk and cfdisk commands are standard Linux utilities. However,
these commands are limited by the fact that they cannot manipulate a
partition while preserving data.
<p>
Instead, Progeny recommends that you use the parted ("partition
editor") utility for manipulating partitions whenever possible.
<p>
Although a command line utility, parted has much of the functionality
of commercial on-the-fly partitioning tools. The utility allows you
to create, delete, resize, and move partitions. You can use it with a
Linux native (ext2) partition, a swap partition, or a fat 32
partition.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Back up all important information.
   
    While parted is generally safe to use, interruptions to your
    computer's problems or other accidents could destroy information.
   
<item> 2 At a command line, type: parted. The parted command line
    starts. At any time, you can type help for a list of available
    commands.
<item> 3 Type select drive to move to the hard drive you want to
    partition. By default, parted uses the first hard drive it finds.
<item> 4 Type print to see a list of partitions on the current hard
    drive.
   
    This information is especially useful when you need to know the
    start and end point of a partition that you are creating.
   
<item> 5 Enter the commands you want to use.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
If you are creating partitions, wait at least five minutes per
partition to ensure that the partition is created. The parted utility
does not indicate when it is finished.
<p>
<list>
<item> 6 Type quit to exit the parted command line for the general bash 
    shell.
</list>
<p>

<sect1 id="mauf">Mounting and Unmounting Filesystems
<p>
Mounting is the process of associating a filesystem with a directory
on your system. A filesystem is a formatted partition or removable
drive.
<p>
Filesystems listed in the /etc/fstab file are generally mounted when
the system starts. The settings in fstab also control how users can
access each filesystem.
<p>
You can also mount or unmount filesystems not listed in fstab.
Removable drives must usually be mounted or unmounted each time you
use them. However you can also set the automounter feature for
removable drives.
<p>
You must always mount a floppy or cd drive before using it, and
unmount it before switching to another floppy or cd .
<p>
At any time, you can see a list of currently mounted filesystems by
opening /etc/mtab or by typing mount at a command line.


<sect2 id="mdwtss">Mounting Drives When the System Starts
<p>
The /etc/fstab ("filesystem table") file lists filesystems that are
mounted when your computer starts. You may choose to add other
filesystems to fstab, but not mount them.
<p>
You need to edit fstab when:
<p>
<list>
<item> You want permanent access to non-Linux partitions.
<item> You add another drive, including any type of removable drive,
    such as a zip drive or cd drive.
<item> You repartition a hard drive.
</list>
<p>
Information about each filesystem is listed in six columns. For
convenience, you can often copy and paste an existing filesystem
definition and modify it for another one.
<p>

&warning-png;
<p>
Do not edit the swap partition or /proc filesystem entries in /etc/
fstab.
<p>
The swap partition enables virtual memory, while the /proc filesystem
is used to gather information for commands such as ps, which reports
on active processes.
<p>
Most users should have no need to edit either entry.

<sect1 id="caspof">Creating a Swap Partition or File
<p>
&progeny-d; creates a swap partition during installation. However,
you may want to add another partition or change the partition. You
may also choose to create a swap file, although a swap partition is
usually more stable.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Do one of the following.
<item> Create the partition or file. See <ref id="pahd"> See
    <ref id="cnfftcl">.
<item> Create a file by typing: dd if=/dev/zero of= file bs= size count=
    size . The size is in bytes.
<item> 2 Set the partition or file for swapping. Type: mkswap partition
    or mkswap file size .
<item> 3 Active the partition or file.
<p>
    To activate swapping temporarily, type: swapon partition or
    swapon file .
<p>
    To use a swap partition permanently, add an entry to /etc/fstab.
    You can copy the existing swap file entry. See <ref id="csiefmf">.
   

&note-png;
<p>
</list>
If you ever need to deactivate a swap partition or file, type:
swapoff partition or swapoff file .


<sect1 id="ctbl">Configuring the Boot Loader
<p>
&progeny-d; uses the Grand Unified Boot Manager ( grub ). The boot
manager is a program that lets you choose which operating system to
use when you start your computer.
<p>
You can also use a boot manager to run different Linux kernels. In
fact, if you recompile the kernel, you can guarantee that your system
remains workable by making a copy of your kernel and adding an entry
for the copy to the boot manager.


<sect2 id="utgnc">Understanding the GRUB Naming Conventions
<p>
grub uses its own naming convention for hard drives and partitions.
This convention is different from either the Linux or Windows
conventions:
<p>
<list>
<item> All numbering starts at 0, so that (hd0) is the first hard drive.
<item> No distinction is made between ide and scsi devices. (hd0) could
    be either type of hard drive.
<item> Primary and extended partitions are numbered from 0 to 3.
<item> Logical partitions are numbered from 4.
<item> All hard drive and partition numbers are enclosed in parentheses.
    For example: (hd0) is the first hard drive.
<item> The partition number follows the hard drive number, with a comma
    between them. For example, (hd1,2) is the third partition on the
    second hard drive.
<item> The root partition is the one that grub is installed on, not
    necessarily the root partition for Linux.
</list>
<p>
You can find complete information about grub by typing info grub at a
command line.


<sect2 id="etbmcf">Editing the Boot Manager Configuration File
<p>
grub files are in /boot/grub. You can edit the boot manager in three
ways:
<p>
<list>
<item> By opening the grub shell with /sbin/grub.
<item> By highlighting an item in the menu as your computer starts and
    pressing the E key. This method is useful only for editing
    existing entries.
<item> By opening /boot/grub/menu.lst in a text editor. This method is
    the easiest, and is the one covered here.
</list>
<p>
The configuration file for the boot manager is /boot/grub/menu.lst.
<p>
menu.lst is divided into groups of options, or stanzas. The first
stanza contains global settings for grub . Each of the other stanzas
contains the settings for one operating system or kernel.
<p>
Unless the default option is used in the global stanza, the default
operating system is the first one after the global stanza.
<p>
Options are generally placed one per line, but this convention is not
necessary. It exists only to make the file easier for people to read.
<p>
Enter options as they appear in the following table, filling in
specific values for the variables.
<p>

<url id="img/System-4.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 At a command line, type: dpkg-reconfigure etherconf. The

<item> 2 Follow the instructions on each screen. You may need to know:
<item> Whether the network card is removable.
<item> Whether the card can be configured with dhcp .
<item> Your computer's ip Address.
<item> The network's netmask.
<item> The gateway.
<item> The hostname.

    then Ctrl-C to stop the effort. Then check the network card.
</list>


<sect2 id="twanc">Troubleshooting With a Network Card
<p>
&progeny-d; should detect most network cards automatically.
However, if you are having trouble establishing a connection:
<p>
<list>
<item> Check that the card is properly installed.
<item> Check that your ethernet card or other network interface card is
    supported by Linux.
<item> Check that your network card is working. Type: ifconfig -a . A
    list of active interfaces displays. Your network card is probably
    /dev/eth0.
<item> Check that your network card is active. Type: ifconfig device up
<item> The card is probably /dev/eth0.
</list>


<sect1 id="camc">Checking a Modem Connection
<p>
Modems are useful for dialup connections to the internet, or for
receiving faxes on your system.
<p>
Modems are probably the most difficult piece of hardware to work with
under Linux. The problem is that many modems today, especially
internal ones, are winmodems. That is, most of them require a running
copy of Windows to work. While a few winmodems have Linux drivers
available, these drivers are usually written for a specific kernel,
and may not work if you upgrade the kernel.
<p>
An external modem or a pcmcia card should generally work. However,
research brands on the internet to see if they are Linux compatible
before you buy.
<p>
To check that Linux recognizes your modem, type dpkg-reconfigure
pppconf at the command line. pppconf is a tool for setting up a
dialup connection. It starts by detecting the modem, then going on to
configure a dialup connection.
<p>
If your modem does not respond:
<p>
<list>
<item> Check that it is not a winmodem.
<item> Check that it is properly connected to your system and to a live
    phone jack.
<item> To ensure that your system can find the modem, create a symbolic
    between the serial port to the /dev/modem device. Type : ln -sf /
    dev/port /dev/modem.
</list>


<sect2 id="suafm">Setting up a Fax Modem
<p>
&progeny-d; does not automatically configure a fax modem for you.
However, you can use the Debian package hylafax-server to receive
faxes via a fax-modem. If you are a desktop user, then you might also
install tkhylafax so that you have a graphical interface. Other fax
packages are also available.
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
Check that your modem is usable under Linux. See 
<ref id="casc">.


<sect1 id="canc">Configuring a Network Connection
<p>
A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) connection is the most
common network connection today. In addition, a dhcp connection is
also used for an adsl or cable internet connection.
<p>
Nowadays, the connection is generally through an ethernet card.
However, another type of network interface card may also be used.


<sect1 id="ptcan">Preparing to Configure a Network Connection
<p>
Before you start to configure the network, you need to know the type
of card you use to connect to the internet.
<p>
On most modern computers, the card should be an ethernet card. If you
are on a laptop, you are probably using an ethernet interface with a 
pcmcia card. Consult the documentation that comes with the card.
<p>
In addition, consult your system administrator or internet provider
for:
<p>
<list>
<item> Your user account.
<item> Your domain name.
<item> Your computer's ip address and hostname.
<item> The ip address of your network.
<item> The netmask to use with your network.
<item> The broadcast address to use on your network.
<item> The ip address of the default gateway system i(f your network has
    a gateway).
<item> The router for your connection.

    be on ttyS0 ( com1 ).
<item> Make sure that your modem is properly setup and turned on.
<item> To ensure that your system can find the modem, create a symbolic

<sect1 id="suem">Setting Up E-Mail
<p>

<url id="img/System-7.png">

<p>
Unless set to local only, e-mail requires a network or dialup
connection. You can configure a network during the install process or
after. A dialup connection is not part of the install program, but
you can set up one after the install process.
<p>
If you need help with the choices on this screen, consult your system
administrator or Internet service provider.

<list>
<item> 1 From the gnome Control Center, select System &gt; Electronic Mail.

<item> 2 Select the General mail setup. Choices are:
<item> Internet Site: The same machine that originates the mail sends it
    and receives any incoming mail.
<item> Internet with smarthost: A dedicated server delivers mail. This
    setting is often used when you are connecting to an Internet
    service provider.
<item> Satellite system: No mail is delivered locally. Mail is delivered
    only through the smarthost.
<item> Local only: E-mail can only be sent and received by users on the
    present machine.
<item> No configuration: No e-mail is configured.
<item> 3 Enter the outgoing mail hostname. Consult your system
    administrator or isp provider for the hostname needed.

<item> 5 Enter the smtp relay host. Consult your system administrator or
    isp provider for the hostname needed.
<item> 6 Check the appropriate box if you want a world-writable mail
    drop.
   
    A world-writable mail drop allows users to receive mail directly,
    instead of only through your network's mail system. It is faster,
    but can be a security risk.
   
    If in doubt, do not select world writable mail drop.

    local mail delivery.
   
    Procmail lets you filter incoming messages and deliver them to

    You can use other tools to filter, so, if in doubt, do not use
    procmail.

<p>

<url id="img/System-12.png">
<p>
<p>
The pointer is usually a mouse. However, it can also be a trackball,
a palette, or any other device that replaces a mouse.
<p>
If you have been using the mouse during the install, you can accept
the settings listed. However, if your mouse is not working, you
adjust the settings.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Select Systems &gt; X Configuration from the gnome Control Center.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
If you are using the kde desktop, type /usr/bin/
xserver-configlet-capplet at a command line.
<p>
<list>
<item> 2 From the X Configuration pane, select the Pointer tab.
<item> 3 Select the port to use.
   
    In most cases, it is /dev/ttyS0 (com1) or /dev/ttyS1 (com2) for a
    serial mouse, or /dev/psaux for a ps2 mouse.
   
<item> 4 Select the protocol or driver to use.
   
    If you are using a serial mouse, then select the name of the
    manufacturer from the drop-down list. Use ps2 for a generic ps2
    mouse.
   
    If you cannot find a protocol for your mouse or pointing device,
    select Auto to have it detected automatically.
   
    You can also try different protocols to see if your mouse can use
    them.
   
<item> 5 Select Emulate 3-button mouse if you have a 2 button one.
   
    With three button emulation, pressing both buttons on the pointer
    is the same as pressing the middle button on a three-button
    pointer.
   
    Linux is designed for use with a three button mouse, so most
    users of two-button mouses should choose this option.
   
<item> 6 Select Enable scroll-wheel event to use a scroll wheel.
   
    If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you probably want this option.
   
</list>


<sect1 id="capm">Configuring a Pointer Manually
<p>
A pointer is usually a mouse, but can include trackballs and other
devices used instead of a mouse.
<p>
To edit the pointer manually, edit the Input Device Section of the /
etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file. Existing entries can help you make your
own.
<p>
Entries are in three columns:
<p>
<list>
<item> First Column: The general listing category. The first two must be
    "Identifier," "Driver." The rest are "Option."
<item> Second Column: The exact listing. The first two must be the
    identifier and the driver. The rest are specific options, and
    must include "Device" and "Protocol."
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
All entries in all columns must be in straight, double quotation
marks.
<p>
<list>
<item> Third Column: The setting for any options. Neither the Identifier
    nor Driver have a third column entry. All entries must be in
    double quotation marks. There must be an entry for the "Device"
    and "Protocol" option.

<sect1 id="af">Adding Fonts
<p>
Linux can support a number of different font formats. The most
commonly used are postscript (also called Type1 or Adobe) and
TrueType font formats. Each format must be set up separately.
<p>
You can also setup fonts separately for programs that use their own
printing systems, such as StarOffice or WordPerfect. However, when
you do, the fonts are available only for the individual programs.
Consult the documentation for these programs for more information.


<sect2 id="aptf">Adding Postscript (Type1) Fonts
<p>
Postscript is a printer language created by Adobe. Postscript fonts
are ones that can be used by postscript without conversion.
Postscript fonts are also called Type1 or Adobe fonts.
<p>
Each postscript font has several files associated with it. The files
have the same name, but a different extension:
<p>
<list>
<item> .afm (short for "Adobe Font Metrics"): Contain the proportions
    for each letter in the font. Necessary for displaying or printing
    the font.
<item> .pfb (short for "Printer Binary Font"): Contain instructions on
    how to print the font.
<item> .inf and .pfm extensions: Not needed for use under Linux.
<item> 1 Install the type1inst package. Type: apt-get install type1inst
<item> 2 Add the .pfb and .afm files for each font to a directory
    accessible to Linux. Common choices are /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/
    Type1 or /usr/share/fonts/type1.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
Because installing fonts is so involved, install as many fonts as you
can at one time.
<p>
<list>
<item> 3 If necessary, add the directory to the Font Paths listed in 
    XF86Config-4.
<item> 4 Change to the directory in which the fonts are installed.
<item> 5 Install the fonts. Type: type1inst .
   
    If you receive a message that the foundry (the distributor of the
    font) is unknown, you can ignore it. It does not affect whether
    you can use the font.
   
    A file called Fontmap is created in the directory. You need this
    file later during the installation of the fonts.
   
<item> 6 Type: mkfontdir . Fonts are now ready for on-screen use.
<item> 7 Make the fonts available to ghostscript so that you can print
    them. Type: cat fontdirectory /Fontmap &gt;&gt; /etc/gs.Fontmap.
<item> 8 Either:
<item> Restart type1inst. Type: /etc/init.d/type1inst force-reload.
<item> Restart your system.
   
    In either case, the postscript fonts are now available for
    on-screen use.
   
<item> 9 Restart your system. The newly installed fonts are now
    available for both screen display and printing.
</list>
<p>
If you want to add more fonts later, follow steps 2 to 7.
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
Some fonts do not display or print properly in Linux, or in some
Linux applications. Dingbats and decorated initials are especially
unlikely to work.


<sect2 id="atf">Adding TrueType Fonts
<p>
TrueType is a popular format for fonts, first introduced on
Macinotosh computers, and later popularized by Windows. Originally,
the postscript printing language did not support them, although that
is no longer true.
<p>
TrueType fonts have the potential to display and print better than
postscript fonts. In practice, however, they do not.
<p>
Aside from the fact that many free TrueType fonts are clumsy
conversions from postscript, current printing and display
technologies cannot take advantage of TrueType's potential.
<p>
Although many users believe that TrueType fonts display better than
postscript fonts, really there is no reason to prefer either format
over the other.
<p>
TrueType fonts include information about displaying and printing in a
single file with a .ttf extension.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Install the xfs and xfstt packages. Log in as the root user and
    type: apt-get install xfs xfstt .
<item> 2 At the top of the list of font paths in the /etc/X11/
    XF86Config-4 file, add the following lines:
</list>
<p>
Fontpath "unix/:7100"
<p>
Fontpath "unix/:7101"
<p>
<list>
<item> 3 Add the TrueType fonts to the /usr/share/fonts/truetype
    directory.
</list>
<p>

&note-png;
<p>
Because installing fonts is so involved, install as many fonts as you
can at one time.
<p>
<list>
<item> 4 Either:
<item> Restart xfs and xfstt. Type: /etc/init.d/xfs force-reload,
    followed by: /etc/init.d/xfstt force-reload.
<item> Restart your system.
   
    In either case, the TrueType fonts are now available for
    on-screen use.
   
<item> 5 Make the fonts available to ghostview for printing. Type: xfstt
    --gslist --sync &gt;&gt; /etc/gs.Fontmap .
<item> 6 Open /etc/gs.Fontmap and add TT- as a prefix to all TrueType
    fonts listed. This step is not necessary, but helps you to tell
    the postscript and TrueType versions of a font apart when they
    appear in a menu.
</list>
<p>
If you want to add more fonts later, follow steps 2-6.
