<chapt id="sastsagi">Starting and Stopping the System and Graphical Interface
<p>
Like any version of Linux, &progeny-d; has strict procedures for
starting and stopping a system. These procedures are part of the
operating system's security features. They also prevent accidental
damage to the system.
<p>
To start your computer, you must choose the operating system to load
from the boot manager, and then log in to a user account.
<p>
To stop your computer, you must log out of the user account, then
halt or reboot the system.
<p>
This chapter explains:

<sect id="wwua">Working With User Accounts
<p>
Linux is designed for multiple users. To use the system, you must log
in with a user account. To use an account, you must know both the
user name and the password.
<p>
User accounts are organized into groups of accounts with similar
access to the system. The software and the hardware you can use
depends on the user account that you are using and the groups to
which it belongs.
<p>
For more information,   
<p>
When you install &progeny-d;, create at least two user accounts: a
regular user account for everyday computing, and a root account for
system administration. Normally, you also want one regular user
account for each person who uses the system.


<sect1 id="urua">Understanding Regular User Accounts
<p>
A regular account is used for everyday computing. Each account has a
home directory. By default, users' home directories are beneath the /
home directory. This home directory is usually the same as the user
name for the account.
<p>
When you are logged in with an account, you usually can:
<p>
<list>
<item> Read, write, and use files and directories in the account's home
    directory.
<item> Read, write, and use all files and directories to which other
    users give you permission.
<item> Read, but not write or use basic system files.
</list>
<p>
On some systems, the system administrator may choose to make basic
system files unreadable by regular users.
<p>
Accounts may annoy those familiar with other operating systems.
However, user accounts have several advantages:
<p>
<list>
<item> Your private files are secure. You can change your setting so
    that other regular users cannot change, nor even see your files.
<item> Your desktop and command line interfaces can be customized.
<item> Viruses are less likely to infect the computer. While viruses are
    not the problem on Linux that they are on other operating
    systems, any damage is likely to affect only one user's files.
<item> Only the root user can use important files. Mistakes, like
    viruses, are likely to affect only a user's personal files.
</list>


<sect1 id="utra">Understanding the Root Account
<p>
The root account has full access to all software and hardware on the
system. In most cases, it should be the only account that has full
access. For this reason, the root user is sometimes called the super
user or privileged user. The root user's home directory is /root.
<p>

<url id="img/Login-1.png">
<p>
The /root directory is different from the root directory at the top
of the Linux directory tree. Nor is it the same as the root partition
- the partition that the root directory is on.
<p>
To avoid damaging your system, take the following precautions when
using the root account:
<p>
<list>
<item> Use the root account only for configuration or administration.
<item> Use the root account as briefly as possible.
<item> Give the root password to as few people as possible. Each of
    those people should use another account for everyday computing.
<item> Do not give root privileges to any other account.
<item> Do not use the root account on the Internet.
<item> Use these precautions even on a single, unnetworked computer.
</list>
<p>
Using the Boot Loader
<p>

<url id="img/Login-2.png">
<p>
Many users have multiple operating systems or Linux kernels on the
same computer. Using a boot loader, you can choose which operating
system or kernel to start your computer with.
<p>
&progeny-d; uses grub (Grand Unified Boot Loader). However, other
boot loaders are widely used, including lilo (the Linux Loader).
<p>
grub is the first thing that you see when starting a &progeny-d;
system.
<p>
You can edit grub to display any installed operating system or
kernels. Your &progeny-d; system also includes a single-user mode.
The single-user mode starts the machine with a basic system that the
root user can use for troubleshooting.
<p>
To choose an operating system from grub , do one of the following:
<p>
<list>
<item> Highlight a menu item by using the arrow keys. Then press the
    Enter key.
   
    or
   
<item> Wait for the default choice to start. The default choice starts
    in 10 seconds if you make no selection.
</list>
<p>
In either case, &progeny-d; starts. After processes are started
and some tests are run, the graphical display starts and the log in
screen opens.
<p>
You can reconfigure grub and add other operating systems to it. See
<ref id="ctbl">.


<sect id="litpd">Logging in to &progeny-d;
<p>

<url id="img/Login-3.png">
<p>
After &progeny-d; has started its initial processes and run some
checks, the log in screen opens.
<p>
Logging in is the process of entering your user account and your
password.
<p>

<url id="img/Login-1.png">
<p>
You cannot bypass this process, the way you can in some operating
systems.
<p>
By default, you log in graphically. However, you can also configure
&progeny-d; to start in a command line instead.


<sect1 id="lig">Logging in Graphically
<p>
From the login window:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 If you want, select options from the menu:
<item> Choose a desktop or window manager from the Session menu.
<item> Choose a language from the Language menu.
   
    In both cases, if you do not make a choice, then the last choices
    you made are used as defaults. Usually, you do not need to make a
    choice.
   
<item> 2 Type your user account name in the login field and press the
    Enter key. The field changes to the password field.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Login-1.png">
<p>
Use the root account only for configuration or administration work.
<p>
<list>
<item> 3 Type the password for your user account.
   
    If you have changed any options since the last time you logged
    in, a dialogue window displays. Select the Yes button to make the
    new options the default.
   
    If you type an account name and password that are entered into
    the system, then the desktop starts.
   
    If the account name or password are incorrect, then you return to
    the login window.
   
</list>


<sect1 id="lifacl">Logging in from a Command Line
<p>
You can log in from a command line if you configure &progeny-d;
not to start the graphical interface automatically.
<p>
You can also start &progeny-d; in single-user mode, which does not
include the graphical interface. If you press Ctrl-D from the log
prompt in single-user mode, the graphical interface starts.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 At the login prompt, type your user account name and press the
    Enter key. The password prompt displays.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Login-1.png">
<p>
Use the root account only for configuration or administration work.
<p>
<list>
<item> 2 Type the password for your user account.
   
    If you type an account name and password that are entered into
    the system, then a command prompt displays and you are ready to
    work.
   
    If the account name or password are incorrect, you return to the
    login prompt.
   
</list>


<sect id="sdpd">Shutting Down &progeny-d;
<p>
Linux is generally running many processes at once. Many of these run
in the background, where they are easy to forget. For this reason,
shutting down the system properly is essential.
<p>
A proper shutdown is often called a graceful shutdown or exit. During
a graceful shutdown:
<p>
<list>
<item> All processes and programs are closed.
<item> All information in ram memory or on the swap partition is written
    to the hard drive.
<item> All log files are updated.
<item> All partitions are dismounted.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Login-4.png">
<p>
If you do not shut down properly, you may damage the operating system
or lose files. At best, the next time you start your computer, you
have a long delay while the root partition is checked.
<p>
You can shut down from:
<p>
<list>
<item> The desktop.
<item> A command line.
<item> The keyboard.
</list>


<sect1 id="sdftd">Shutting Down from the Desktop
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 From the menu, select Logout. A confirmation window displays.
<item> 2 If you have any unsaved changes to the desktop, select the Save
    current setup box.
<item> 3 Select the Yes button to log out and return to the log in
    screen.
<item> 4 From the login screen, you can:
<item> Log in as another user. If you only need to change user accounts
    briefly, you may prefer to use su instead. See <ref id="cua">.
<item> Select System &gt; Reboot from the menu. The system shuts down and
    restarts.
<item> System &gt; Halt from the menu. The system shuts down.
   
    If you select Reboot or Halt, a confirmation screen appears.
   
<item> 5 Select the Yes button to reboot or halt the system.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Login-4.png">
<p>
If you do not shut down properly, then you risk damaging the
operating system. Even if no damage is done, your system checks the
root partition before restarting.
<p>
A quicker alternative is to open the command line and shut down from
there. See <ref id="sdpd">-check: enabled?


<sect1 id="sdftcl">Shutting Down From the Command Line
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Log in as the root user.
<item> 2 From the command line or from a command line window, enter one
    of the following commands:
<item> halt : All processes immediately stop and the system shuts down.
<item> shutdown halt + minutes or shutdown halt hh:mm : A warning
    message displays until all processes stop and the system shuts
    off.
   
    minutes is the number of minutes before the system shuts down.
   
    hh:mm sets the time in hours and minutes for the shutdown using a
    24 hour clock.
   
<item> reboot : The system shuts down and restarts.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Login-1.png">
<p>
Use the shutdown command to give regular users time to save their
work.
<p>

<url id="img/Login-4.png">
<p>
If you do not shut down properly, then you risk damage the operating
system. Even if you don't, your system will check and, if necessary,
repair the root partition before restarting.


<sect1 id="sdftk">Shutting Down From the Keyboard
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Press the Ctrl-Alt-Backspace keys in sequence. The desktop
    closes, and the log in screen opens.
<item> 2 From the login screen, you can:
<item> Log in as another user. If you only need to change user accounts
    briefly, you may prefer to use su instead. See <ref id="cua">.
<item> Select System &gt; Reboot from the menu. The system shuts down and
    restarts.
<item> System &gt; Halt from the menu. The system shuts down.
   
    If you select Reboot or Halt, a confirmation screen appears.
   
<item> 3 Select the Yes button to reboot or halt the system.
</list>


<sect id="sasdtgi">Starting and Shutting Down the Graphical Interface
<p>
Linux uses the X Window system for a graphical interface, such as a
desktop and/or a window manager. See <ref id="ugi">.
<p>
You can choose to start a graphical interface automatically when you
start your computer. This is the default setup for &progeny-d;.
Alternatively, you can start the X Window system from the command
line.


<sect1 id="sagiftcl">Starting a Graphical Interface From the Command Line
<p>
You must have the X Window System installed as well as a desktop and/
or window manager.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Log in to a command line. See <ref id="lifacl">.
<item> 2 Type: startx . The X Window System starts and the login window
    displays.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Login-1.png">
<p>
The X Window System is not loaded if you are starting from
single-user mode.
<p>
<list>
<item> 3 Log in. See <ref id="lig">.
</list>


<sect1 id="etgi">Exiting the Graphical Interface
<p>
You can:
<p>
<list>
<item> Exit the X Window System and keep it running in the background.
<item> Close down a X Window System session that you started from the
    command line.
</list>


<sect1 id="ktxwsritb">Keeping the X Window System Running in the Background
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Press Ctrl-Alt-F1. A full screen command line displays with a
    login prompt.
<item> 2 Log in. See <ref id="lifacl">.
   
    To return to the desktop, press Alt+F7. You return to your
    original user account.
   
</list>


<sect1 id="cdaxws">Closing Down an X Window System
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Open a command line from the panel.
<item> 2 Log in as the root user. See <ref id="cua">.
<item> 3 From a command line, type /etc/init/d/gdm stop. Then press the
    Enter key.
   
    A full screen command line displays with a login prompt.
   
</list>


<sect id="cua">Changing User Accounts
<p>
From both the command line and the desktop, you can logout as one
user, then login as another. However, a more convenient way to change
accounts is to use the su command ("switch user" or "set user").
<p>
This command is especially useful if you need to log in briefly as
the root user while using a graphical interface. However, to use it
effectively, you need to be comfortable working from the command
line.
<p>
To change user accounts:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 If necessary, open a command line from the panel.
<item> 2 From a command line, type su - user command.
   
    You do not need to enter a command.
   
    If you do enter a command, you use the other user account only to
    run that command. Then you return to your original account.
   
    A password prompt appears if you are logged in as a regular user.
   
    If you are logged in as the root user, then no password prompt
    displays.
   
<item> 3 If necessary, enter the password for the account that you are
    logging into.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Login-1.png">
<p>
You have changed accounts only for the command line you are using. If
you are running a desktop, then you are still logged in with your
original account in other windows.
<p>
<list>
<item> 4 If you changed accounts without running a command, repeat this
    process to return to your original account.
   
    If you run a command, you return to your original account as soon
    as the command is carried out.
</list>
