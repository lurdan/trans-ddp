<chapt id="mtdyo">Making the Desktop Your Own
<p>
gnome is famous for being highly customizable. You can customize
almost every feature globally or individually. For example, you can
customize all the panels on the desktop, or just one.
<p>
Customization controls are scattered throughout the desktop. However,
most of them are available from:
<p>
<list>
<item> The gnome Control Center icon on the panel.
<item> The Settings menu.
<item> Pop-up menus for different parts of the desktop.
</list>
<p>
This chapter mentions only the most common customization features. It
directs you to where you can customize:
<p>
<list>
<item> Display settings.
<item> General settings for the gnome desktop and the Sawfish window
    manager.
<item> Program launchers (icons).
<item> General desktop behavior, including confirmation dialogs.
<item> The panel.
<item> The menu.
<item> Individual windows.
<item> The program launched when a type of file is selected (mime Type )
</list>
<p>
For complete information about the features that you can customize,
see the on-line gnome help.
<p>
If a feature are unfamiliar to you, whenever possible, many
customization settings let you use the Try and Revert buttons. Use
the Try button to test the new settings, then the Revert button to
reverse the changes.
<p>
Some changes may have no effect until you reboot or restart the X
server.
<p>

If you change window managers, some of your configuration options may
change.

This chapter assumes that you are working with a default desktop
using the Sawfish window manager.
