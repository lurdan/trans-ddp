Automating Multiple Installs
<p>
Once you have installed Progeny Debian on a single system, you can
automate other installs by creating an automated install floppy. The
automated install floppy is inserted in the floppy drive when you
start an install.
<p>
Making the automated install floppy consists of two steps:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Creating the configuration files.
<item> 2 Creating the automated installer floppy.
</list>
<p>
Creating Configuration Files
<p>
The configuration files are created on an existing Progeny Debian
system, then copied to the floppy for use during the install.
<p>
You should know that:
<p>
<list>
<item> scsimod .lst, netmod.lst, and sources.lst can be blank, but must
    be in the /conf directory with the other configuration files.
<item> postinst is not required.
</list>
<p>
Place all finished configuration files in a directory named /conf.
This directory can be a sub-directory any place on the system.
Commands to create the automated install floppy are run from this
directory.
<p>
Examples of configuration files are available in /usr/share/doc/
autoinstall/.
<p>
Creating the Global Configuration File (global.cfg)
<p>
The global.cfg file contains the master information for the automated
install. One option is entered per line. When an option requires a
value, leave a space between the option and the value.
<p>
                   Options for the global.cfg File                   
                                                                     
<example>
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Option |                       What It Does                        |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
|       |The url for the minimal system's tar file.                 |
|       |                                                           |
|baseurl|The url can be a cd (cdrom:) or a web address (http://).   |
|       |                                                           |
|       |This option is required.                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
|       |The password hash for the root user.                       |
|rootpwd|                                                           |
|       |This option is required.                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
|nosafe |Continues the install, even if a filesystem exists on the  |
|       |target machine.                                            |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
|       |Allows the automated installer to configure the network.   |
|       |Possible values are:                                       |
|network|                                                           |
|       |  * dhcp: Use dhcp .                                       |
|       |  * netdb: configure using the network.cfg file.           |
|       |  * none: do not configure the network.                    |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
|cdinst |Install using a cd , instead of a network.                 |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
|nfscd  |The path to an nfs -mounted cd image that will be used for |
|       |the installation.                                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
</example>
<p>
Creating the debconf Configuration File (debconf.cfg)
<p>
Make a copy of the debconf database. Type: / usr/sbin/readdebconf /
conf /debconf.cfg.
<p>
Creating the Network Modules File (netmod.lst)
<p>
The netmod.lst file lists the scsi kernel modules to load. Modules
are listed one per line.
<p>
Look at the example provided. Type: less /usr/share/doc/autoinstall/
examples/netmode.lst on an existing Progeny Debian System. The file
must be configured to fit your hardware.
<p>
Creating the SCSI Module File (scsimod.lst)
<p>
The scsimod.lst file lists the scsi kernel modules to load. Modules
are listed one per line.
<p>
Look at the example provided. Type: less /usr/share/doc/autoinstall/
examples/scsimod.lst on an existing Progeny Debian System. The file
must be configured to fit your hardware.
<p>
Creating the Network Configuration Database (network.cfg)
<p>
The network.cfg file describes the network and all machines on it.
The file consists of pairs of stanzas.
<p>
The first stanza in a pair is the global stanza. Global stanzas may
be added for any network or routers. Global stanzas contain the
following entries, with one characteristic per line:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 gateway
<item> 2 network
<item> 3 netmask
<item> 4 name server
<item> 5 broadcast
<item> 6 domain name
</list>
<p>
Leave a space after each characteristic, then add the value for
characteristic.
<p>
The second stanza in each pair is a local stanza. It defines local
machines attached to the network or to the router. Each line defines
a single machine. Each machine is defined by three columns:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 mac address (ethernet card id )
<item> 2 ip address
<item> 3 host name
</list>
<p>
Columns are separated by a single space
<p>
At the bottom of a local stanza, you can add a default entry. The
default entry is used if a machine cannot be otherwise connected to
the machine. The default entry uses default for the mac address and 
unassigned for the host name.
<p>
Creating the Partitioning Information File (partinfo.cfg)
<p>
The partinfo.cfg file describes how the install program should
partition each system during an automated install.
<p>
One line is used for each partition. Each line has the same format:
<p>
partitiontype filesystem size mountpoint size
<p>
The size is either m (megabytes) or % (percentage of total disk
space).
<p>
In most cases, you want at least a root partition and a swap
partition.
<p>
                       Entries in partinfo.cfg                       
                                                                     
<example>
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Entry   |                        Choices                        |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------|
|partition  |  * primary.                                           |
|type       |  * logical.                                           |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------|
|filesystem |  * ext2: Linux native.                                |
|           |  * swap: Linux swap.                                  |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------|
|size       |Any size, given in megabytes.                          |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------|
|           |The file should include at least one partition mounted |
|           |as root (/).                                           |
|mountpoint |                                                       |
|           |A swap file has no mount point, but is entered as swap |
|           |.                                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
</example>
<p>
Creating the Package Selection List (select.cfg)
<p>
The select.cfg file lists the packages to install. To create the
file, type: dpkg --get-selections &gt; /conf /select.cfg on an existing
Progeny Debian System, then edit if desired.
<p>
Creating the Post Installation Script (postinst)
<p>
The post installation script is a series of commands that are run
after installation is complete. The script can be written any
language supported by the fully installed system.
<p>
The post installation script is optional. It is not needed for an
automated install.
<p>
Creating the Sources List File (sources.lst)
<p>
This file is a list of sources for apt . It can be copied from any
sources list for apt . You can create it by:
<p>
<list>
<item> Typing cp /etc/apt/sources.lst /conf /sources.lst.
<item> Creating a plain text file called sources.lst in the target
    directory with the following line: deb http://archive.progeny.com
    /progeny progeny main contrib non-free.
</list>
<p>
Creating the Automated Installer Floppy
<p>
Before creating the floppy for the automated installer, you must
create all configuration files and place them in the /conf directory.
Only the postinst file is optional.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 From the /conf directory, type: make-autoinst-initrd 
    kernel_version .
   
    The kernel version is the version of the kernel that you want to
    use on the floppy to create the initial ram disk that is used to
    start the system. The kernel must be installed on the system that
    you are currently using.
   
<item> 2 Place a floppy disk in the drive. The drive is mounted
    automatically in the next step.
<item> 3 From the /conf directory, type: make-autoinst-disk 
    kernel_version .
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/appendix-a.png">
<p>

Enter the same kernel version as you did in the first step.
<p>
    The automated install floppy is created.
   
Starting an Automated Install
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Check that you have an install source. The install source can
    be:
<item> A cd.
<item> A cd image available over an nfs -mounted cd image.
<item> An url . In this case, sources.lst must point to a valid Progeny
    mirror.
   
    Whatever the source, it must be specified in the global.cfg file.
   
<item> 2 Place the automated install floppy in the floppy drive.
<item> 3 Start the machine. The install proceeds, drawing information
    from the auto-install floppy as needed.
</list>
