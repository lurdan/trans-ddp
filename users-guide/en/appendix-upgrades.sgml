Upgrading from Debian and Debian-Based Distributions
<p>
You can upgrade to Progeny Debian from various releases of Debian and
from several Debian-based distributions.
<p>
This appendix includes information about upgrading from:
<p>
<list>
<item> Debian releases.
<item> Debian 2.2 with Ximian (Helix Code) gnome .
<item> va Linux's distribution of Debian.
<item> Storm Linux.
<item> Libranet.
<item> Corel Linux.
</list>
<p>
All upgrades are done using apt-get . If you are not familiar with 
apt-get, See Installing and Removing Packages With the apt-get
Command..

<sect id="ufdr">Upgrading from Debian Releases
<p>
This section contains information about upgrading from:
<p>
<list>
<item> Older Debian versions (2.1 and earlier).
<item> Debian 2.2.
<item> Debian Testing Release.
<item> Debian Unstable Release.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="ufodv">Upgrading from Older Debian Versions
<p>
Upgrading from versions of Debian before 2.2 are not supported by
&progeny-l-s;.
<p>
If you want to attempt an upgrade anyway, do one of the following:
<p>
<list>
<item> Follow the instructions for upgrading from 2.2.
   
    or
   
<item> Upgrade to Debian 2.2, then follow the instructions for upgrading
    from Debian 2.2.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="ufd2">Upgrading from Debian 2.2
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Add the following line at the top of the /etc/apt/sources.list
    file: deb http://archive.progeny.com/progeny stable main contrib
    non-free .
<item> 2 Run the following commands:
<item> a apt-get update .
<item> b apt-get -f dist-upgrade .
<item> c apt-get install debconf .
<item> d apt-get install progeny-potato-upgrade .
<item> 3 Install the Progeny Debian standard system package. Type: a
    pt-get install progeny-standard-system .
<item> 4 Remove the Progeny Debian upgrade package. Type: dpkg --remove
    progeny-potato-upgrade .
<item> 5 Restart your system. This step is recommended, but optional.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="uftdtr">Upgrading from the Debian Testing Release
<p>
Upgrading from the Debian testing release may have mixed results.
Depending on when the release was last upgraded, it many contain
packages that Progeny Debian has not tested. Because of the strong
possibility that upgrades from the testing release will cause
problems on your system, &progeny-l-s; does not support them.
<p>
If you want to try an upgrade anyway, backup all important
information and follow the instructions for upgrading from Debian
<list>
<item>2.
</list>
<p>
Otherwise, do a complete install that includes reformatting of all
Linux partitions.
<p>
<sect id="ufdur">Upgrading from the Debian Unstable Release
<p>
The Debian unstable release is changing rapidly, and includes many
packages not tested by Progeny. For these reasons, upgrading from the
Debian Unstable Release is not supported by Progeny Linux systems.
Instead, do a normal install, reformatting all Linux partitions.
<p>
<sect id="ufvlds">Upgrading from VA Linux Debian Set
<p>
The va Linux Debian distribution was released between Debian 2.1 and
<list>
<item>2, and is a mixture of the two.
</list>
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Add the following line at the top of the /etc/apt/sources.list
    file: deb http://archive.progeny.com/progeny stable main contrib

<sect id="ufd2wxhg">Upgrading from Debian 2.2 With Ximian (Helix) GNOME
<p>
Ximian gnome (formerly known as Helix) is a customized version of the
gnome desktop. It may be installed over an existing Debian version,
most likely Debian 2.2. It is also a standard part of the Storm hail
release and the latest releases of Libranet.
<p>

<url id="img/appendix-u.png">
<p>
Due to the timing of releases, systems using earlier versions of
Debian with Ximian gnome are uncommon.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Add the following line at the top of the /etc/apt/sources.list
    file: deb http://archive.progeny.com/progeny stable main contrib
    non-free .
<item> 2 Remove Ximian's customized packages. Enter the following series
    of commands:
<item> a apt-get remove mc-common .
<item> b apt-get remove libpopt0 .
<item> c apt-get remove libgtk1.2 .
<item> d apt-get remove gnome-games-locale .
<item> 3 Repeat the following command until all package dependencies
    have been satisfied: apt-get -f dist-upgrade .
<item> 4 Install the Progeny Debian 2.2 upgrade package. Type: apt-get
    install task-progeny-potato-upgrade .
<item> 5 Install the Progeny Debian standard system package. Type: a
    pt-get install progeny-standard-system .
<item> 6 Remove the Progeny Debian 2.2 upgrade package. type: dpkg
    --remove progeny-potato-upgrade .

<sect id="ufsl">Upgrading from Storm Linux
<p>
Storm Linux is a Debian-based distribution, available in two
releases: rain and hail.
<p>
To upgrade the Storm Linux rain release, follow the instructions for
upgrading from older versions of Debian.
<p>
To upgrade the Storm Linux hail release, follow the instructions for
upgrading from Debian 2.2 with Ximian gnome .
<p>
<sect id="ufl">Upgrading from Libranet
<p>
Libranet is a Debian-based distribution, available in a number of
releases. Before upgrading, check which version of Debian the
Libranet release is based on, then follow the instructions for that
Debian version.
<p>
The latest versions of Libranet can be upgraded by following the
instructions for upgrading from Debian with Ximian gnome .
<p>
<sect id="ufcl">Upgrading from Corel Linux
<p>
Corel Linux is a Debian-based distribution, available in two
releases. Because of the extensive changes in Corel Linux, upgrading
it to Progeny Debian is neither recommended nor supported.
<p>
Instead, users of all releases of Corel Linux should backup all
important information, and do a complete install of Progeny Debian
that includes reformatting all Linux partitions.
<p>
To reproduce the look and feel of Corel Linux as closely as possible,
install kde from the Extras cd and use it as the default desktop.
