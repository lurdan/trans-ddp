Preparing to Install Progeny Debian
<p>
Installing Linux is much easier than it was a few years ago. However,
if you have never installed an operating system, installing Linux can
still be nerve-wracking. You may find that your hardware either does
not support Linux or needs to be configured manually to work well.
<p>
To avoid trouble during the install, gather the information you need
during the install before you start. This chapter explains how to:
<p>
<list>
<item> Meet hardware requirements.
<item> Name partitions according to Linux's and Windows' conventions.
<item> Save data from accidental loss during the install.
</list>
<p>
Understanding Your System's Hardware
<p>
In most cases, you can let Progeny Debian detect your hardware and
accept the settings suggested during the install. However, these
suggestions may not always work. To minimize problems, before you
install, you should:
<p>
<list>
<item> Gather information about your hardware before you start to
    install. At the very least, have the information handy if you
    need it.
<item> Check hardware compatibility.
<item> Check that your computer meets the minimum requirements for the
    type of install that you want to do.
</list>
<p>
Finding Sources of Hardware Information
<p>
Hardware information can be gathered from:
<p>
<list>
<item> The manuals that come with each piece of hardware.
<item> The bios setup screens of your computer. You can view these
    screens when you start your computer by pressing a combination of
    keys. Check your manual for the combination. Often, it is the
    Delete key.
<item> The cases and boxes for each piece of hardware.
<item> The System window in the Windows Control Panel.
<item> System commands or tools in another operating system, including
    file manager displays. This source is especially useful for
    information about ram and hard drive memory.
<item> Your system administrator or Internet Service Provider. These
    sources can tell you the settings you need to set up your
    networking and e-mail.
</list>
<p>
Gathering Hardware Information
<p>
The exact information you need depends on how much control you want
over the install:
<p>
<list>
<item> If you want, you can let the installer automatically partition
    your hard drive and accept the settings that the installer
    suggests.
   
    However, these settings may not be the best ones for your
    hardware.

<p>

</list>
Do not do an automatic installing without backing up important
information. Otherwise, you may lose the information.
<p>
<list>
<item> If you want a custom install, the following table shows the
    information needed.
   
    To save time, collect this information before you start the
    install. At the very least, know where you can find the
    information quickly.

If you need to contact Progeny technical support, you will probably
need to provide additional information before technical support can
help you.

Checking Hardware Compatibility
<p>
Many brand name products work without trouble on Linux. Moreover,
hardware for Linux is improving daily. However, Linux still does not
run as many different types of hardware as some operating systems.
<p>
In particular, Linux usually cannot run hardware that requires a
running version of Windows to work.
<p>
Although some Windows-specific hardware can be made to run on Linux,
doing so usually requires extra effort. In addition, Linux drivers
for Windows-specific hardware are usually specific to one Linux
kernel. Therefore, they can quickly become obsolete.
<p>
So called win-modems are the most common type of this hardware.
However, printers and other equipment may also be Windows-specific.
<p>
Progeny suggests that you avoid all such hardware.
<p>
You can check hardware compatibility by:
<p>
<list>
<item> Checking manufacturers' web sites for new drivers.
<item> Looking at web sites or manuals for information about emulation.
    Lesser known brands can sometimes use the drivers or settings for
    better-known ones.
<item> Checking hardware compatibility lists for Linux, such as
    www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html.
<item> Searching the Internet for other users' experiences.
</list>
<p>
Meeting Minimum Hardware Requirements
<p>
Once you have gathered information about your computer's hardware,
check that your hardware will let you do the type of installation
that you want to do.
<p>
Depending on your needs, you might manage with less than some of the
recommended hardware listed in the table below. However, most users
risk being frustrated if they ignore these suggestions.
<p>
         Recommended Minimum System Requirements         
                                                         
<example>
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|Install Type|  Processor   |     RAM     | Hard Drive  |
|------------+--------------+-------------+-------------|
|No desktop  |Pentium 100   |16 megabytes |450 megabytes|
|------------+--------------+-------------+-------------|
|With Desktop|Pentium 100   |64 megabytes |1 gigabyte   |
|------------+--------------+-------------+-------------|
|Server      |Pentium II-300|128 megabytes|4 gigabytes  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+

If you are using a desktop, you will find that some window managers
run better with more ram .
<p>
Gathering Information About Linux Device Names
<p>
Linux uses its own system for naming hardware. If you know this
system during installation, you can choose your options more
intelligently. You can also avoid over writing partitions that you
want to keep.
<p>
Understanding Device Names
<p>
All operating systems use a system for naming devices such as hard
drive partitions and serial and parallel ports.
<p>
Partitions are subdivisions of your hard drive. Serial and parallel
ports are connectors on the back of your computer where devices such
as a mouse or printer can be connected to the system.
<p>
No matter what operating system you are using, hard drives are
divided into partitions. Partitions can be of three types: primary,
extended, and logical.
<p>
A hard drive can have up to four primary partitions. However, as hard
drives grew in size, a way around this limitation was needed. The
answer was extended partitions, which can be partitioned into any
number of smaller or logical drives.
<p>
Finding Information About Partitions
<p>
You can find information about your partitions by using:
<p>
<list>
<item> fdisk on Linux or Windows.
<item> cfdisk on Linux.
<item> gnu parted on Linux.
<item> PartitionMagic from Windows or a boot floppy.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Pinstall-1.png">
<p>

Do not use PartitionMagic to create Linux partitions. Progeny
Debian's install program is not compatible with
PartitionMagic-created partitions. The result may be the loss of all
partitions and all the data on them.
<p>
Instead, use the Install cd to start your machine, and open a virtual
terminal by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F2. Then use the parted tool. See
Partitioning a Hard Drive..
<p>
Understanding Windows Device Names
<p>
Many users are familiar with Window's naming system:
<p>
<list>
<item> A and B are the first and second floppy drives.
<item> The first primary partition is C. Often, this is the only
    partition on a Windows system.
<item> All primary partitions on all hard drives are named first.
<item> Logical drives are named, starting with the first one on the
    first hard drive.
<item> The last drive letter is the cd drive.
<item> Serial ports are prefixed with com and start at 1.
<item> Parallel ports are prefixed with lpt and start at 1.
</list>
<p>
The Windows naming system has several problems. First, few modern
computers have a second floppy drive. Therefore, B is rarely used.
<p>
More importantly, if you add or delete one partition, the names of
many partitions can change. As a result, you can easily lose track of
your partitions.
<p>
Understanding Linux Device Names
<p>
Linux takes a consistent approach to naming. All drives and ports are
named in the same way:
<p>
<list>
<item> An id for the type of device. These id s include hd for an ide
    hard drive, ttyS for a serial port, and lp for a parallel port.
<item> A letter id for the device. If, like most users, you have an ide
    system, then:
<item> a is the primary master device.
<item> b is the primary slave device.
<item> c is the secondary master device.
<item> d is the secondary slave device.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Pinstall-2.png">
<p>

Check your bios or the contents of each device to find details about
master and slave devices.
<p>
<list>
<item> A number id for the partition or port. Primary or extended
    partitions are named 1-4, while logical partitions are named 5 or
    higher.
<item> Serial and parallel ports start with 0 , and can have any number.
</list>
<p>
For example, the first partition on the first ide hard drive is hda1
<list>
<item> Similarly, the first serial port is ttyS0 .
</list>
<p>
This naming convention is simple, and gives you information about
your system. The device id gives you information about the type of
hardware installed, while the partition id tells you whether it is a
primary or logical partition.
<p>
In addition, if you add or delete partitions, only the number id
changes.
<p>
Even then, it can only change so far. A logical partition can never
become hda4 , because 4 is reserved for primary partitions.
<p>
By contrast, D could be either type of partition under Windows.
<p>
Similarly, when you re-arrange primary partitions on one hard drive,
the numbering of primary partitions on other hard drives is
unaffected.
<p>
Under Windows, changing primary partitions on any drive affects all
primary partitions on the system.
<p>
Reading Linux Device Names
<p>
Before you install, decide whether you want to keep any existing
partitions on your system.
<p>

<url id="img/Pinstall-1.png">
<p>

Linux partitions made with PartitionMagic are not compatible with the
Progeny Debian install program.
<p>
If you do, then translate the partition names to the Linux
conventions so that you know where they are when you install.

|                            |       |then:                         |
|Partitions on a scsi hard   |       |                              |
|drive or a cd drive         |sd     |  * 1 to 4 for a primary      |
|                            |       |    partition.                |
|                            |       |  * 5 or more for a logical   |
|                            |       |    partition.                |

|----------------------------+-------+------------------------------|
|Parallel ports              |lp     |A number, starting with 0.    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
</example>
<p>
Translating Windows Names to Linux Names
<p>
If you are installing Linux on an existing computer, translate
Windows names to Linux names to avoid confusion.
<p>
For example, if all your Windows files are on C, then you need to
translate C into the Linux name if you want to be sure that you never
delete or reformat the partition.
<p>

<url id="img/Pinstall-2.png">
<p>

On most computers, your Windows C partition is hda1 in the Linux
naming system. However, check before working with any partitions.
<p>
Notice, too, that port names on Windows start with 1, while on Linux
they start with 0.

<p>
Backing Up Your System
<p>
Before you start to install Progeny Debian, back up your system. At
the very least, make copies of important files. You may also want to
create new rescue disks for existing operating systems.
<p>
So long as you are careful, these precautions should be unnecessary.
However, even experienced computer users can make mistakes, or face
an unexpected power interruption. If anything does happen, backing up
your system will save you hours of time and trouble.
