<chapt id="gtktd">Getting to Know the Desktop
<p>
Most operating systems offer two ways to interact with your computer:
a desktop and a command line.
<p>
In popular operating systems, the command line is usually
de-emphasized. Progeny suggests that you take a mixed approach to
Linux.
<p>
For routine work, the desktop is convenient and easy to learn.
However, consider using the command line for complex work. The Linux
command line takes longer to learn than a graphical interface, but in
many circumstances it is easier and quicker to use.
<p>
The default graphical interface for &progeny-d; is gnome (gnu 
Network Object Model Environment). This chapter describes the
features of gnome. However, you may also install kde (The K Desktop
Environment) from the Extras CD. The two desktops have similar
features and functionality.
<p>
Most modern computer users (at least those installing Linux) know the
basics of using a desktop. For this reason, this chapter is written
more to point out features than to explain them. Its main focuses
are:
<p>
<list>
<item> Where to find features that you already know.
<item> What features new Linux users may not know.
</list>
<p>
For more detail, see the gnome on-line help.


<sect id="ugi">Understanding Graphical Interfaces
<p>
Unlike other popular operating systems, Linux lets you customize all
the parts of your graphical interface.
<p>
Linux uses the X Window System (also called "X," but "X Windows"is
considered insulting by many) to display graphics. The X Window
System uses three parts to provide a graphical interface:
<p>
<list>
<item> The X server: The program that provides basic graphical support.
    The default X server for most versions of Linux is XFree86.
<item> The window manager: A program that controls the placement and
    movement of windows on the interface. A few window managers have
    so many features that they are almost desktops in their own
    right. &progeny-d; uses Sawfish, currently the most popular 
    gnome window manager.
<item> The desktop: A program that includes a set of features that works
    with the windows manager to provide a complete graphical
    environment.
</list>
<p>
You can choose each of these parts separately. Only a few Linux users
change the X server, but many change the window manager and desktop
regularly. Some users prefer a window manager, but no desktop.
<p>
In addition, you can also change the look of a window manager or
desktop by changing themes, the default colors and designs. Entire
web sites are devoted to themes, notably www.themes.org.


<sect id="gtktpodd">Getting to Know the Parts of the Default Desktop
<p>
The gnome desktop is similar to desktops on other operating systems.
However, take the time to find where the parts of the desktop are.
Some features may not be in the position you expect, while. others
can be reached in more than one way.
<p>
You can add many features to the gnome desktop. However, the default
desktop consists of:
<p>
<list>
<item> The Menus.
<item> The Panel.
<item> The File Manager.
<item> Workspaces.
</list>


<sect1 id="tmenus">The Menus
<p>
You can select a program to run by opening one of two menus:
<p>
<list>
<item> The gnome main menu at the top left of the screen.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-1.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The Programs item in the pop-up menu for the work space.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-2.png">
<p>
To have a menu or sub-menu stay open, double-click on the top part
above the dotted line. The menu becomes a regular window. This
feature is sometimes called a "tear-off menu."


<sect1 id="tpanel">The Panel
<p>
The panel runs across the top of the desktop. It contains the menu,
icons (or launchers), and commonly used tools. The default panel
contains:
<p>
<list>
<item> The gnome menu on the left.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-3.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The gnome Help icon for on-line help.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-4.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The browser icon for your internet connection.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-5.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The gnome Control Center for configuring the desktop. 
    See <ref id="mtdyo">.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-6.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The Add/Remove Software icon.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-7.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The terminal icon for opening a command line.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-8.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The gnome Desktop Guide, or pager, beside the task list. The
    pager opens a list of currently running processes and shows where
    windows are open on the work space.
   
    Select the pager to open or close it.
   

<url id="img/Desktop-9.png">
<p>
</list>
<p>
<list>
<item> The status dock for showing the windows on each workspace.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-10.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> The task list for displaying minimized windows on the right.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-11.png">
<p>
<p>
   
    Notice, too, the arrows on each side of the panel. Selecting an
    arrow slides the panel shut to give more room in the workspace.
    Selecting an arrow again slides the panel back into position.
   

<url id="img/Desktop-12.png">
<p>
<p>
   
    You can add other panels, or other items to the default panel as
    you need. Useful items include:
   
<list>
<item> Drawers: Pull-down menus of icons (launchers), which group icons
    and save space.
<item> Applets: Various small tools and monitors, including one for
    laptop batteries.
<item> Clocks: Several different styles time-pieces.
</list>
<p>
See <ref id="mtdyo">.


<sect1 id="tfm">The File Manager
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-13.png">
<p>
<p>
The default file manager is the gnome Midnight Commander. You can
start it by:
<p>
<list>
<item> Selecting Program &gt; File Manager from the main menu.
<item> Selecting New Window from the pop-up menu that starts when you
    right-click on the desktop.
<item> Typing gmc at a command line.
<item> Selecting the Home directory icon.
</list>


<sect1 id="tworkspaces">The Workspaces
<p>
Using gnome , you can create multiple or virtual desktops called
workspaces. Each workspace can have columns or rows that help to
position windows. See <ref id="mtdyo">.
<p>
Multiple workspaces require more memory to run. However, they can be 
useful if:
<p>
<list>
<item> You have a small monitor.
<item> You want a different set of launchers for different tasks.
<item> You work with many windows open, so that you have a hard time
    keeping track of them.
<item> You want to keep a window open for use, but do not want it always
    taking up room on your main workspace.
</list>
<p>
If necessary, you can turn off multiple workspaces to save memory.


<sect2 id="mbw">Moving Between Workspaces
<p>
To move between workspaces, do one of the following:
<p>
<list>
<item> Select a workspace on the pager.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-14.png">
<p>
<p>
   
    or
   
<list>
<item> Middle-click on the current workspace and select another one.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-15.png">
<p>
<p>
From the Workspace sub-menu, you can:
<p>
<list>
<item> Select a workspace.
<item> Select the next or previous workspace.
<item> Customize how the workspace functions.
</list>


<sect id="fywatd">Finding Your Way Around the Desktop
<p>
The gnome desktop works in much the same way as other desktops:
<p>
<list>
<item> You start programs by left-clicking on an icon or a menu item,
<item> You set properties by right-clicking on a desktop element.
<item> Windows are minimized or maximized using either their menus or
    the icons in the upper right corner.
<item> Windows become active (or come into focus, as gnome puts it) by
    clicking with the mouse on any part of them.
<item> Minimized (also called "iconified") windows display in the task
    list.
<item> The Trash can stores deleted files in case you want to restore
    them.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-16.png">
<p>
<p>
However, if you are new to Linux, some of its functions may be
unfamiliar to you. Instead of repeating what you already know, this
section concentrates on these unfamiliar functions.


<sect1 id="uatbm">Using A Three Button Mouse
<p>
Like other Linux desktops, gnome is designed for a three button
mouse. If your mouse only has two buttons, then you can choose during
the install to emulate a three-button mouse by pressing both buttons
at the same time is the same as using the middle mouse button.
<p>
In most circumstances:
<p>
<list>
<item> The left mouse button selects an icon or menu item to start.
<item> The right mouse button displays a pop-up menu. Often, this menu
    is used for setting the properties of a desktop element, such as
    an icon.
<item> The middle button is used for other functions, if they exist.
</list>
<p>
To see other functions for the mouse buttons, roll the mouse over a
part of the desktop to see a pop-up list.
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-17.png">


<sect1 id="utdpum">Using the Desktop Pop-Up Menus
<p>
The panel, the menus, launchers, and the work space all have pop-up
menus, However, the work space has two pop-up menus:
<p>
<list>
<item> Clicking with the right mouse button on a blank space on the
    desktop opens the desktop pop-up menu.
   
    From this menu, you can create launchers (icons), rescan the
    desktop to update it, and set other desktop properties.
   

<url id="img/Desktop-18.png">
<p>
</list>
<p>
<list>
<item> Clicking with the middle mouse button on a blank space opens a
    general pop-up menu.
   
    From this menu, you can see a list of opened tasks, navigate
    between virtual desktops, select a program to run, or customize
    the desktop.
   

<url id="img/Desktop-19.png">
<p>
</list>


<sect1 id="uks">Using Keyboard Shortcuts
<p>
To save time, you can add keyboard shortcuts for basic desktop tasks
by selecting Sawfish Window Manager, then Shortcuts from the Control
Center.
<p>
Only a few shortcuts are defined by default. However, you can add a
long list of keyboard shortcuts, or edit existing ones. See 
<ref id="mtdyo">.


<sect1 id="mwindows">Manipulating Windows
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-20.png">
<p>
<p>
An open window in the default &progeny-d; theme has :
<p>
<list>
<item> An "X" icon in the upper right corner to close the window
<item> An up arrow icon in the upper left corner to maximize the window.
<item> A down arrow icon in the upper left corner to minimize the
    windows.
<item> A menu that you can open by right clicking on the title bar. From
    the menu, you can minimize, maximize, or close the window, and
    manipulate it in other ways as well.
   
    In addition, a window appears in the task list and the pager on
    the panel if it is on the current work space.
   
</list>
However, the window menu and the pop-up menu in the task list also
let you manipulate an open window in ways that may be unfamiliar to
you.
<p>

<sect1 id="rip">Reading Icon Properties
<p>
You can add three main types of icons to the desktop:
<p>
<list>
<item> Directory: A folder on the desktop.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-21.png">
<p>

<p>

<url id="img/Desktop-23.png">
<p>
<p>
   
    No matter where they are - the work space, the menu, or the panel
    - all icons have the same properties. You can read an icon's
    properties by selecting Properties from its pop-up menu to open
    the Properties window.
   

<url id="img/Desktop-24.png">

    on which the file was created, last modified, and last accessed.
    Using the Properties window, you can change the file name.
<item> Options: Sets the icon to use for the file. If you do not want to
    use the default icon for the file type, you can select a custom
    icon by clicking on the icon pane.
<item> Permissions: Sets who owns the file, who can use the file, and
    how they can use it. You can only adjust these settings if you
    own the file or if you are logged in as root user. See
