This chapter focus on Progeny Debian using Progeny installer.
Standard debian may adopt this in future but current standard 
Debian installer behaves differently.  Read this chapter as 
such.

<sect id="instpdebian">Installing &progeny-d;
<p>
This chapter explains how to install Progeny Debian for the first
time.
<p>
If you want to:
<p>
<list>
<item> Upgrade an existing Debian or Debian-based operating system,  .
<item> Do identical installs on different machines, See Automating
    Multiple Installs..
</list>
<p>
Progeny Debian features a graphical installer. The installer
automatically detects many types of hardware, and suggests many
settings.
<p>
If you do not need a graphical display, you can use text-mode from
the second stage of the install onwards. The first stage of the
install uses a basic vga mode which almost every system should be
able to support.
<p>
If you run into problems, you can usually follow the settings
suggested by the installer and get a working system.
<p>
After configuration, you can fine-tune the configuration from within
Progeny Debian.
<p>
Installation should take 30-60 minutes. The exact time depends on
your choices, your experience, and the speed of your system.
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
If you have already installed Progeny Debian on your system, use the
Add/Remove Software option to upgrade your system rather than
reinstalling. Unlike some commercial distributions, Progeny Debian is
not designed to reinstall over an existing system.
<p>
Installation consists of five steps:
<p>
<list>
<item> Organizing the install.
<item> Installing the minimal system.
<item> Configuring Progeny Debian.
<item> Selecting and installing software.
<item> Installing Software on the Extras cd .
</list>
<p>
<sect id="oti">Organizing the Install
<p>
Immediately before installing, you need to:
<p>
<list>
<item> Prepare for the install.
<item> Choose the order in which to install different operating systems.
<item> Decide on your install source and prepare for its use. Progeny
    Debian can be installed from:
<item> A floppy and cd.
<item> A cd.
<item> A network.
<item> Start the install.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="pfti">Preparing for the Install
<p>
Collect the information about your system that you need, and have it
handy during the install. Depending on how you choose to install,
this information may include:
<p>
<list>
<item> The partitions on the hard drive and which ones already contain
    an operating system.
<item> The manufacturer and model for your video card, monitor, and
    printer.
<item> Settings for your network or for your internet connection.
</list>
<p>
In addition, back up any information that you do not want to lose.
Errors or power surges and interruptions during the install could
lose or corrupt it.
<p>
For complete information about preparing for an install, See
<ref id="ptipd">.
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
Linux partitions created using PartitionMagic are incompatible with
the Progeny Debian install program. If you have any, delete them and
re-create the partitions using parted or the Progeny Debian
installer.
<p>
<sect id="imos">Installing Multiple Operating Systems
<p>
If you are going to install more than one operating system on the
same machine, install all versions of Windows first. Otherwise, the
Windows installation program may destroy your ability to start other
operating systems or encourage you to reformat partitions with other
operating systems.
<p>
You can recover from these actions or avoid them, but installing
Windows first saves you trouble.
<p>
<sect id="pacofi">Preparing a CD or Floppy Installation
<p>
Depending on your computer, you may need to change the boot order in
the bios so that you can start from a cd or floppy.
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
You only need the floppy if your computer cannot start from a cd .
<p>
The boot order is a listing of the drives that your computer tries to
start from, and the order in which drives are tried. Your machine
starts with the first operating system that it finds.
<p>
How you change the boot sequence may depend on whether you have an 
ide or scsi system.
<p>
<sect id="ctbooi">Changing the Boot Order on IDE Computers
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 As your computer starts, press the keys to enter the bios 
    utility. Often, it is the Delete key. However, consult the
    hardware documentation for the exact keystrokes.
<item> 2 Find the boot sequence in the setup utility. Its location
    depends on your bios , but you are looking for a field that lists
    drives.
   
    Common entries on ide machines are C, A, cdrom or A, C, cdrom .
   
    C is the hard drive, and A is the floppy drive.
   
<item> 3 Change the boot sequence setting so that the cdrom or the
    floppy is first. Usually, the Page Up or Page Down keys cycle
    through the possible choices.
<item> 4 Save your changes. Instructions on the screen tell you how to
    save the changes on your computer.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
Remember to change the boot order after the minimal Progeny system is
installed, so that you restart your machine from the hard drive.
<p>
<sect id="ctboos">Changing the Boot Order on SCSI Computers
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 As your computer starts, press the keys to enter the scsi setup
    utility.
   
    You can start the scsi setup utility after the memory check and
    the message about how to start the bios utility displays when you
    start your computer.
   
    The keystrokes you need depend on the utility. Often, it is
    Ctrl-F2. However, consult your hardware documentation for the
    exact keystrokes.
   
<item> 2 Find the utility for changing the boot order.
<item> 3 Set the utility so that the scsi id of the cd drive is first on
    the list.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
If you need to use the floppy drive, follow the instructions for
changing the boot order on ide computers. Floppies are never scsi
devices.
<p>
<list>
<item> 4 Save your changes. Instructions on the screen tell you how to
    save the changes on your computer. Often, you must press F10.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="ifaf">Installing From a Floppy
<p>
If your computer cannot start from the cd drive, you need to start
from a floppy disk:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Check that the computer is set to boot from the floppy drive. 
    See <ref id="pacofi">.
<item> 2 Place the Install floppy in the floppy drive.
<item> 3 Place the Progeny Debian cd in the cd drive.
<item> 4 Restart your computer. The installation program begins.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="ifan">Installing From a Network
<p>
A network install provides a single install source for multiple
machines. When doing a network install, you might want to create an
auto-install floppy. See Automating Multiple Installs..
<p>
If you do not understand networks, do not attempt a network install
without the help of your system administrator.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Insert the Progeny Debian cd or install floppy . Then restart
    your computer. A text screen opens, giving instructions for a
    network install. A command line is at the bottom of the screen.
<item> 2 At the command line, type: linux nfscd host:path options
   
    You must enter the host and the path.
   
    If you have a dhcp connection, the network configuration is
    automatically detected. Otherwise, you may need to add other
    options.

<sect id="ipdwagd">Installing Progeny Debian Without a Graphical Display
<p>
The Progeny Debian installer is designed primarily for users who want
a graphical display. However, you may decide not to use a graphical
display (the X Window System) if you are an experienced user, or are
installing a server.
<p>
If you do not want a graphical display, note the following steps:
<p>
<list>
<item> Start the minimal install with the command linux secondstage=
    text. The minimal installation will use a generic vga display,
    but the other stages will be text based.
<item> At the start of the configuration stage, do not select X
    configuration.
<item> During the software installation stage, do one of the following:
<item> De-select the pre-selected gnome and X Window package set.
<item> Leave the default package sets, then remove the gnome and X
    Window package set once Progeny Debian starts.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="ntip">Navigating the Install Program
<p>
The install program detects your mouse so that you can use it during
the install.
<p>
The install program uses a simple set of buttons for navigation:
<p>
<list>
<item> Back: Returns you to the previous screen.
<item> Next: Moves to the next screen.
<item> Cancel: Exits the install program.
</list>
<p>
In some cases, a button may not be available until a task is
completed.
<p>
<sect id="nwam">Navigating Without a Mouse
<p>
If your mouse does not work in the install program, you can use the
keyboard to navigate the menu choices. Later, you can configure your
mouse in the Pointer screen or after the install.
<p>
To navigate the install program without a mouse, use:
<p>
<list>
<item> The left arrow key or Shift-Tab key to move between buttons and
    selections in the current screen.
<item> The space bar to select an item in the current screen.
<item> The Enter key to activate choices.
</list>
<p>
<sect id="oavtft">Opening a Virtual Terminal for Troubleshooting
<p>
If you have trouble installing Progeny Debian, you can open a virtual
terminal:
<p>
<list>
<item> During the minimal install stage, press Ctrl-Alt-F2. Press Alt-F7
    to return to the install.
<item> During the configuration stage, middle-click anywhere on the
    screen except for the window.
<item> During software installation, the output displays for you.
</list>
<p>
You may also want to open a virtual terminal if you need to use 
parted to partition your hard drive before installing.
<p>
<sect id="itms">Installing the Minimal System
<p>
Installing the minimal system is the first stage in the installation
of Progeny Debian. Installing the minimal system consists of three
steps:
<p>
<list>
<item> Selecting the target installation: Determining which hard drive
    and partitions are used.
<item> Partitioning your hard drive: Creating and formatting the
    partitions for the install.
<item> Configuring the system start-up: Choosing whether to use the grub
    boot manager, an existing boot manager (such as lilo ), or no
    boot manager.
</list>
<p>
Once you have made your choices, the necessary partitions are
prepared and the minimal system is installed.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Start your machine with the Install cd and, if necessary, the
    Install Floppy.
   
    See <ref id="pacofi"> See Installing From a
    Floppy.
   
    A text introduction appears.
   

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
</list>

<item> 2 Do one of the following:
<item> Start a network install by entering a command at the prompt at
    the bottom of the screen. See <ref id="ifan">, or
    press F1.
   
    or
   
<item> Set the install program to use a non-graphical install after the
    minimal installation. The minimal install uses a basic vga mode
    that should be usable on any computer.
   
    At the command prompt, type: linux secondstage=text, then press
    the Enter key.
   
    or
   
<item> Start an install by pressing the Enter key.
   
    In all cases, the install program starts to load.
   
    After a moment, the install program starts and the Welcome screen
    opens.

    Each target uses your hard drive in a different way:
   
<item> Entire drive: The entire hard drive is used for the install.
   
    A Linux swap partition of 125 megabytes is created for you. The
    rest of the drive is used for a Linux partition.
   
<item> Free space: Only the free space on the hard drive is used.
   
    The first available free space on any hard drive that is greater
    than one gigabyte is used for the install. The Linux partition is
    as large as possible. The swap partition is 125 megabytes in
    size.
   
<item> Custom partitioning: The hard drive is used the way that you
    decide.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
Back up all important information before doing custom partitioning.
Otherwise, you may lose information.
<p>

<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
If an error dialog opens, asking whether you want a new partition
table created, select the No button. Otherwise, all partitions on
your hard drive are destroyed.
<p>
Before continuing, use the Install cd to start your system, then used
parted from a virtual terminal to create partitions.
<p>
<list>
<item> If you selected custom partitioning, divide your hard drive the
    way you want if you selected Custom partitioning. Then press the
    Next button. See <ref id="caep">.

reinstall may fail.
<p>
    In all cases, the Configure System Startup screen opens.
   

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> 6 Choose the boot loader to use:
<item> Use grub : By default, Progeny uses the Grand Unified Bootloader 
    (grub) .
   
    If you previously installed another boot loader, you may need to
    edit grub to add other operating systems. See Configuring the
    Boot Loader..
   
    If you are already using grub, and have Windows on the first
    partition of the first hard drive, an entry for Windows is
    automatically created.
   
    If you have Windows installed on another partition, you must
    manually reconfigure grub to start Windows. See Configuring the
    Boot Loader..
   
<item> Use a different boot loader: Select if you plan to keep using a
    different boot loader, such as lilo, that is already installed.
    You may need to edit entries after configuration.
   
    grub is loaded on to the root partition for Progeny Debian.
   
<item> Do Not Install a Boot Loader: No bootloader is used. The standard
    master boot record on the computer is used.
   
    You will only be able to use Progeny Debian until you set up and
    configure a bootloader.
   
<item> Create a Startup Floppy: Select this option to create a boot
    floppy as an alternate means of booting your system.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
Do not select both Create a Startup Floppy and Do Not Install a Boot
Loader together. If you do, then the floppy will not be bootable.
<p>
    When choosing this option, you should know that:
   
<list>
<item> Booting from a floppy is considerably slower than other choices.
<item> All information on the floppy is over written. Back up any
    important information before creating the floppy.
<item> The install floppy that comes with the Progeny Debian box set can
    be used as a recovery disk, but the one created with this option
    is specific to your system.
   
    Select the Next button when you are finished. The Preparing
    System Screen opens.
   
<item> 7 Wait while the installer partitions and formats your hard
    drive, then installs the minimal system. The Preparing System
    screen displays the progress.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">

<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
Progress for formatting the disk shows the percentage of partitions
created, not the total amount of hard drive space formatted.
<p>
    Installing a minimal system takes about 10 to 15 minutes.
   
    When the minimal system is installed, the Next button is enabled.
    Press the Next button to complete the minimal system
    installation.

<sect id="stit">Selecting the Installation Target
<p>
Selecting the Installation Target is the first step in configuring
the minimal system. Unless you select Custom partitioning, it is also
the only step.

<sect id="caep">Creating and Editing Partitions
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
<p>
When you select Custom partitioning as your installation target, the
Edit Partitions screen opens. Using the Edit Partitions screen, you
can create, delete, or edit partitions.
<p>
Partitions are divisions of your hard drive.
<p>
You need at least a root partition before you can continue the
install. You should also add a swap partition for virtual memory.
<p>
If you want, you can also create other partitions.
<p>
For example, many Linux users prefer to have personal files on a
separate partition to make back ups easier. Similarly, some put
printer queues on a separate partition to limit their size.
<p>
To create or edit a partition:
<p>

If you are editing an existing partition, you cannot change the type
or size. Nor can you make a swap partition bootable.

    You must have a root partition. In addition, you probably want a
    swap partition. You may also want to create other partitions.
   
    You can change the mount point of an existing partition without
    losing the information on it.
   
    However, if you select the Format? box, you lose all information

<item> 2 Select the protocol or driver to use.
   
    If you are using a serial mouse, then select the name of the
    manufacturer from the drop-down list. Use ps2 for a generic ps2
    mouse.
   
    If you cannot find a protocol for your mouse or pointing device,
    select Auto to have it detected automatically.
   
    You can also try different protocols to see if your mouse can use
    them.
   
<item> 3 Select Emulate 3-button mouse if you have a 2 button one.
   
    With three button emulation, pressing both buttons on the pointer
    is the same as pressing the middle button on a three-button
    pointer.
   
    Linux is designed for use with a three button mouse, so most
    users of two-button mouses should choose this option.

If you need help with the choices on this screen, consult your system
administrator or Internet service provider.

<list>
<item> 1 Select the General mail setup. Choices are:
<item> Internet Site: The same machine that originates the mail sends it
    and receives any incoming mail.
<item> Internet with smarthost: A dedicated server delivers mail. This
    setting is often used when you are connecting to an Internet
    service provider.
<item> Satellite system: No mail is delivered locally. Mail is delivered
    only through the smarthost.
<item> Local only: E-mail can only be sent and received by users on the
    present machine.
<item> No configuration: No e-mail is configured.
<item> 2 Enter the outgoing mail hostname. Consult your system
    administrator or isp provider for the hostname needed.
<item> 3 Enter the incoming mail hostname. Consult your system
    administrator or isp provider for the hostname needed.
<item> 4 Enter the smtp relay host. Consult your system administrator or
    isp provider for the hostname needed.
<item> 5 Check the appropriate box if you want a world-writable mail
    drop.
   
    A world-writable mail drop allows users to receive mail directly,
    instead of only through your network's mail system. It is faster,
    but can be a security risk.
   
    If in doubt, do not select world writable mail drop.
   
<item> 6 Check the appropriate box if you want to use "procmail" for
    local mail delivery.
   
    Procmail lets you filter incoming messages and deliver them to
    folders other than your Inbox.
   
    You can use other tools to filter, so, if in doubt, do not use
    procmail.

    These names can help you identify the printer.
   
    The short name appears on the printer spool, that stores files
    before they are sent to the printer, and in configuration files.
    The long name is used mainly to help you identify the printer.
   
    At some companies, printers are named with a theme, such as
    animals or famous people.
   
    However, names based on some combination of the manufacturer,
    model, and or path name of the printer may be easier to work
    with.
   
<item> 3 Select the location of the printer:
<item> Local: the printer is attached to the machine on which you are
    installing. You need to enter the device to which the local
    printer is attached. Usually, the device will be the first
    parallel port, /dev/lp0.
<item> Remote: The printer is on a network to which your machine is
    attached. You need to enter:
<item> The hostname: The machine to which the printer is attached.
<item> The printer name: The name of the printer on the system to which
    it is attached.
   
    If you do not have this information, consult your system
    administrator.
   
<item> 4 Select the printer driver from the list. Printers are listed by
    manufacturer, then by model.

    non-postscript printers.
   
<item> 5 Select the Apply button to enter the printer definition.
<item> 6 Add any other printer definitions by repeating this process.
    Notice that the definition you just entered is now listed in the

Progeny Debian pre-selects the following package sets:
<p>
<list>
<item> Character-mode mail and news clients.
<item> gnome applications.
<item> gnome desktop system.
<item> Mozilla
<item> Netscape
<item> X Window System
</list>

De-selecting the pre-selected packages then selecting Apply could
remove parts of the operating system that you want to keep. Instead,
use the Revert button and select packages individually.
<p>
The time taken to install other software depends on your choices, and
the speed of your machine. However, in most cases, choosing and
selecting the software should take 15 to 20 minutes.
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Decide what package sets to install. To gather information to
    help you decide:
<item> Select a package set: A brief description displays in the bottom
    pane.
<item> Double-click on a package set: A window displays the packages
    that make up the set. If you have any familiarity with Linux, you
    can decide which packages to select.
<item> Refer to the table at the end of this section. This table helps
    you decide whether you need a particular package set.
<item> 2 Select the software to install. When a package set is selected,
    the box beside it has a check mark and its name displays in red.

    package set and how much space all your choices and the base
    system need.

<sect id="isfte">Installing Software From the Extras CD
<p>
Progeny Debian includes an Extras cd with additional software,
including the kde desktop, a popular choice for a graphical display.
<p>
To install software from the Extras cd:
<p>
<list>
<item> 1 Log in to the system as the root user.
<item> 2 Open a command line by selecting the icon on the top panel.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
<p>
<list>
<item> 3 At the prompt, type: apt-cdrom add. Then follow the on-screen
    instructions, placing the Extras cd into the drive to add its
    package sets to the list on your system.
<item> 4 From the menu in the top left corner of the screen, select
    Programs &gt; System &gt; Add/Remove Software.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Installing.png">
<p>
<p>
   
    The Configure Software screen opens. The screen resembles the one
    that you used to add software during the install, except that now
    it includes the contents of the Extras cd as well.
   
<list>
<item> 5 Select the package sets to install.
<item> 6 If you choose, double-click on a package set to view or select
    the individual packages in the set.
<item> 7 Select the Apply button to install the software.
</list>
<p>
The installation of your Progeny Debian system is now complete.
<p>
If you need to fine-tune the system configuration, use the System
tools in the gnome Control Center. They are similar to the screens
that you use during installation.
<p>
If you want to add software or upgrade the system, use the apt-get
utility or select Programs &gt; System &gt; Add/Remove Software from the
main menu. Re-installing over an existing Progeny Debian system is
often difficult.
<p>
If you do re-install, backup all important information and reformat
the partitions you are using.
