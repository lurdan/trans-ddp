Reading System Information
<p>
Linux is built by users who have a hands-on approach to computing. As
a result, your system includes many command line tools for displaying
information.
<p>
You can view information about:
<p>
<list>
<item> The operating system and hardware.
<item> Processes running on the system.
<item> Memory being used and memory available.
<item> Users.
</list>
<p>
You can gather information by:
<p>
<list>
<item> Using command line tools.
<item> Viewing files in the /proc directory.
<item> Reading log files.
</list>
<p>
Graphical tools have been made for some of the command line tools,
but they are generally less complete and flexible than the command
line tools.
<p>
Reading System Information From the Desktop
<p>
Progeny Debian installs with three basic desktop information tools:
<p>
<list>
<item> System Info: Basic information about your system.
<item> gtop : Processes, memory and filesystems.
<item> gw : Information about users.
</list>
<p>
In addition, the Applets menu includes several useful monitors that
display graphs of how the system is being used. In particular, laptop
users might want to install the battery charge applet on the panel.
<p>
Using System Information from the Desktop: Using the System Info Tool
<p>
The System Info tool is the graphical equivalent of the uname -a and 
w commands.
<p>
<list>
<item> From the main menu, select Applications &gt; System &gt; System Info.
    The System Info window opens.
</list>
<p>

<p>

<p>
<list>
<item> If you want to save the information select either:
<item> Save Information to File.
<item> Email Information.
   
    A dialogue box opens for you to select or enter a file name or
    e-mail address.
   
</list>
Viewing Process Information from the Desktop: Using the gtop Command
<p>
<list>
<item> Start the command:
<item> Type gtop from a command line.
   
    or
   
<item> Select gtop from the pop-up menu of some Monitor applets.
   
    In either case, the gnome System Monitor window opens.
   

<url id="img/Sysinfo-2.png">
<p>

</list>
If you use the command regularly, add it to the workspace, panel, or
menu.
<p>
<list>
<item> Select the statistics to display. Select Settings &gt; Preferences
    from the menu.
<item> Select a tab to display. Either click on the tab with the mouse,
    or select a tab from the View menu. By default, the tab displays
    are:
<item> Processes: Processes that are currently running on the system.
   
    The statistics to display can be altered in the Settings&gt;
    Preference menu. The tab includes graphs for cpu, memory, swap
    and average loads.
   
    This tab is the desktop equivalent of the top or ps command.
   

<url id="img/Sysinfo-3.png">
<p>

</list>
<p>
<list>
<item> Memory usage: The amount of memory used by each process in
    relation to each other.. This figure does not represent an
    absolute amount of ram .
   
    This tab is the desktop equivalent of part of the top command.
   

<url id="img/Sysinfo-4.png">
<p>

</list>
<p>
<list>
<item> Filesystems: The amount of hard drive space that is free on each
    partition or hard drive.
   
    This tab is the desktop equivalent of the df command .
   

<url id="img/Sysinfo-5.png">
<p>

</list>
<p>
Viewing User Information from the Desktop: Using the gw Command
<p>

<url id="img/Sysinfo-6.png">
<p>

<p>
The gw utility is the desktop equivalent of the w command. It
displays informations about users.
<p>
If you are logged in as root user, gw displays information about all
users currently logged in. If you are logged in as a regular user,
then only information about the current account displays.
<p>
Type gw from a command line. The Active User screen opens.
<p>

<url id="img/Sysinfo-2.png">
<p>

If you use the command regularly, add it to the workspace, panel, or
menu.
<p>
From the Active User screen, you can read such information about
where users logged in from (local or remote), how long they have been
logged in, and the processes they are currently running.
<p>
Using the Monitor Applets
<p>
The Applets are small programs that are a standard part of the gnome
desktop. When selected, an applet displays in the panel.
<p>
The Monitor manuals are among the most useful applets. Each gives a
graphic display of some aspect of the system. To add one to the
panel, go to Applets &gt; Monitors on the main menu.
<p>
                           Monitor Applets                           
                                                                     
<example>

Using Command Line Tools
<p>
Linux includes many commands for gathering information. The following
table summarizes some of the more common and more useful ones.
<p>
To read a complete list of options for each command, see its man or
texinfo pages. See Finding Help for Commands..
<p>
The following tables are divided into four categories:
<p>
<list>
<item> System information commands.
<item> Memory information commands.
<item> Processes information commands.
<item> User information commands.

Reading /proc Files
<p>
The /proc directory contains several files that are useful when you
are configuring or troubleshooting your system.

Changing these files can damage your system. Regular users should not
have write permission to these files, and the root user should be
careful about changing them.
<p>
Reading Log Files
<p>
Log files record messages about all activities on your system. Some
can be viewed by regular users, but many can only be viewed by the
root user.
<p>
Logs are generally found in the /var/log directory. Their purposes
are usually obvious: cron.log lists messages from crontab, daemon.log
lists messages from daemons, and so on. The general log file is /var/
log/messages. See Standard Log Files..
<p>
Logs are controlled by syslogd daemon. This daemon starts almost as
soon as your computer starts, and records most events that happen on
the system. It is configured in the /etc/syslog.conf file.
<p>
You can view logs from either the desktop or the command line.
Information is in four column in standard log files.
<p>
A few log files are not in the standard format. They cannot be read
by using desktop tools, nor, in several cases, by using the standard
command line viewing tools. See Non-Standard Log Files.
<p>
Reading Standard Log Files From the Desktop
<p>
<list>
<item> From the menu, select Programs &gt; System log monitor. The System
    log viewer window opens.
</list>
<p>

<url id="img/Sysinfo-8.png">

<list>
<item> Choose a log to display. Select File &gt; Open log. The default is /
    var/log/messages.
<item> If necessary, select an item from the View menu:
<item> Calendar: A monthly calendar.
</list>
<p>

<item> Zoom: Details about the currently selected message, along with a
    brief explanation of the message.
</list>
<p>

<p>

<p>
Reading Standard Log Files From the Command Line
<p>
Standard logs are plain text files. You can use any viewing tools or
text editors to view logs from the command line. The most useful
tools are less, head, and tail. See Viewing Files From the Command
Line..
<p>
Keeping a Log File Open Using the tail Command
<p>
If you are troubleshooting, you may want to keep a log file open so
that you can constantly refer to it:
<p>
<list>
<item> Log in as root user and open a command line.
<item> Type: tail -f log .
   
    The -f option keeps the tail viewing command open as new messages
    are added to it.

Reading Non-Standard Log Files

Several useful log files are not in standard format. As a result,
they cannot be read by the System log monitor tool on the desktop.
Several must be read using unique command line tools.

Creating Custom Logs Using Redirection
<p>
Error messages for Linux commands display by default in the command
line. However, you can redirect messages to a file to create a custom
log for a particular command or script. Type: command 2&gt; file.
