	<heading>The main components of a system</heading>
	<p>
	  A Debian system comprises a computer, with devices to enable
	  it to communicate with the outside world, temporary and permanent
	  storage, and the software to make it all work.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Linux is available for a number of different types of computer.
	  The original Linux kernel was written for the Intel 80386, and
	  descendants of this processor power the majority of Linux
	  systems at present.  However, there are also versions of Linux
	  for DEC Alpha, Motorola, Power PC, ARM, Amiga, MIPS, Sun SPARC
	  and others.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Debian has distributions for x86, DEC Alpha, ARM, Motorola 68k,
	  MIPS, Motorola/IBM PowerPC, Sun SPARC, Sun UltraSPARC and
	  GNU/Hurd. (The last-named is not a machine but a new operating
	  system from the Free Software Foundation.)
	</p>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>The hardware</heading>
	  <p>
	    The minimum needed for any computer system is a
	    <strong>processor</strong> (or <strong>CPU</strong>), some
	    permanent storage (whether modifiable or not), some working
	    memory, an input device (usually a keyboard) and an output device
	    (usually a screen, but it could be a printer or even an array of
	    lights).  The usual configuration of a PC is a box containing a
	    <strong>CPU</strong>, a small amount of Read Only Memory
	    (<strong>ROM</strong>) and from 4 to 256 Megabytes of Random
	    Access Memory (<strong>RAM</strong>).  These are mounted on a
	    motherboard, which also contains components such as a clock
	    and interfaces to various kinds of input and output
	    (<strong>I/O</strong>) devices.  The motherboard also contains a 
	    <strong>BIOS</strong> chip which contains the program which 
	    starts the computer working when it is reset or powered up.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Inside the computer box, with the motherboard there are usually
	    one or more disk drives, either removable or permanent, and there
	    may well be a CD/ROM drive.  Special "cards" are plugged into
	    the motherboard to manage networking, video display, sound and
	    so on.  Some motherboards may include these functions and not
	    need extra cards.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Outside the computer box will be peripheral devices of various
	    kinds.  These will almost always include a video monitor and a
	    keyboard.  There will probably also be a mouse.  Systems with a
	    soundcard will have speakers.  There may be a modem, printers,
	    graphics pad, music keyboard, scanner, external disk drives,
	    and so on; the list is almost endless.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    All these devices are controlled by software; first by the
	    <strong>BIOS</strong>, then by the boot loader which is
	    run by the <strong>BIOS</strong> and finally by the
	    <strong>operating system</strong>.  In Debian's case, that
	    operating system is the Linux <strong>kernel</strong>.
	  </p>

	<sect1>
	  <heading>The Linux kernel</heading>
	  <p>
	    The Linux kernel is a program that is running all the time from
	    the moment that a Debian system is booted.  It is responsible
            for servicing all running programs when they make `system calls',
	    which are requests to run part of the kernel code - for instance,
	    reading from a device.  No program can operate without calling
	    on the kernel for some services.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The kernel consists of the base kernel itself and a number of
	    modules, which can be loaded on demand.  Once loaded, these
	    modules become part of the kernel itself, and can be called on in
	    the same way. However, when they are no longer required they can
	    be unloaded, thus saving memory.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Each Debian distribution comes with a pre-built kernel and modules
	    that handle most devices you are likely to have.  However, you
	    can rebuild the kernel to match your own particular setup, either
	    to accommodate unusual devices or to save space by removing support
	    for devices you do not have.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Linux kernel development is continually in progress.  Kernel
	    version numbers indicate how up-to-date the kernel is.  At the
	    time of writing (September 1998), the current stable kernel is
	    2.0.35 and the development kernel is 2.1.119.  Development kernels
	    have an odd number in the second part of their version numbers.
	    When 2.1 is thought sufficiently stable, it will be renamed 2.2
	    and will become the new stable release.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The current stable Linux kernel should always be available as a
	    Debian package, and there is also a package called kernel-package
	    which you can use to make your own customised version of the
	    kernel without conflicting with Debian's packaging system.
	  </p>

	  <heading>Devices</heading>
	  <p>
	    Every computer has a number of devices, ranging from its own
	    memory to external hardware.  These devices are controlled by
	    device drivers which are either built into the kernel or loaded
	    from kernel modules. (It is possible, but unusual, for device
	    drivers to be user programs rather than kernel code.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Devices are accessed through device nodes, which are stored in
	    the <tt>/dev</tt> directory.  Most operations can be done
	    through these device nodes.  For device-specific actions,
	    <strong><tt>ioctl</tt></strong> calls can be made to the device
	    driver.  Retensioning a tape, for example, is done through an
	    <strong><tt>ioctl</tt></strong> call.
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Filesystems</heading>
	  <p>
	    Disk devices support filesystems, in which all the information
	    available to the computer is stored.  Filesystems are organised
	    as directory trees.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Every Unix computer has at least one filesystem available at all
	    times: this is the <strong>root</strong> filesystem, which is
	    under the directory `<strong>/</strong>'.  All other filesystems
	    that may be available are mounted under the root
	    filesystem, so that all the filesystems appear as a unified whole.
	    Filesystems on other machines can be mounted, and even these
	    appear as if they were under the root.
