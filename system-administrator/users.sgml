	  <heading>Usernames and User IDs</heading>
	  <p>
	  Each user of a UNIX system such as Debian has a
	  username which uniquely identifies them.  Usernames are
	  associated with user IDs (or UIDs), and in fact it is the UID
	  which the underlying system uses to identify users; usernames,
	  however, are more mnemonic and tend to be used for most
	  day-to-day purposes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Usernames are typically composed of alphanumeric characters,
	  that is letters and numbers.  Most usernames are forms of the
	  user's own name (for instance "jane", "janedoe", or "jdoe") or
	  relate to a role or a pseudo-user created for the purpose of
	  administering part of the system, for instance "root" (for the
	  superuser account) and "www-data" (for the account which owns
	  and runs web servers and related services under Debian).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  UIDs are numbers from zero to 65534.  The numbers are grouped
	  as follows:
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  UIDs 0-99 are globally allocated by the Debian project and are
	  used for system accounts.  The "root" account, for
	  instance, is UID 0.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  UIDs 100-999 are for system users which have are not allocated
	  by the Debian project.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  UIDs 1000-29999 are normal user accounts.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  UID 65534 is user "nobody", an account with no rights or
	  permissions.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  For more information about the allocation of UIDs, see the
	  Debian policy manual.
	  <!-- XXX what reference link should I use here? -->
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Users may usually be referred to by either username or UID.
	  </p>
	 
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Groups and Group IDs</heading>
	  <p>
	  Groups are used to refer to logical groups of users on the
	  system.  Groups have group IDs (GIDs) just as users have UIDs,
	  and the numeric ranges for different types of groups are the 
	  same as those for users.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A typical example of a group on the system might be "webadmin"
	  where people who administer a website might be grouped
	  together.  This would allow users to create files and
	  directories to which all of the "webadmin" group had read or
	  write access.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Groups may usually be referred to by either their name or GID.
	  </p>

	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Passwords</heading>
	  <p>
	  Each user on a Debian system has a password which they must
	  use to login to the system.  This password is initially
	  specified at the time of account creation, and may be changed
	  at any time by the user or by the system administrator.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Passwords are stored in an encrypted format
	  on the system.  The type of encryption used is referred to as
	  one-way or "trapdoor" encryption, meaning that it cannot be
	  reversed to find the original password.  Instead, the password
	  typed by the user at login time is similarly encrypted, and
	  the two encrypted versions are compared to see if they are the
	  same.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Passwords are typically composed of alphanumeric and
	  punctuation characters.  It is considered good practice to
	  choose a password which contains a mixture of upper and lower
	  case characters, numbers, and punctuation, as makes it harder
	  to guess and less susceptible to a "dictionary" attack,
	  whereby each word in a dictionary is encrypted and the
	  encrypted versions compared to the encrypted passwords on the
	  system.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Shadow passwords are used as a means of hiding even the
	  encrypted form of password from users.  The normal password
	  file is world-readable, however the shadow password file is
	  only readable by the superuser.
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Quotas</heading>
	  <p>
	  A concept related to users, in that it is often part of the
	  account creation process, is that of quotas.  Quotas allow the
	  system administrator to restrict the amount of disk space used
	  by a user.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  This subject is discussed in more detail in the filesystems
	  chapter of this manual.  See <ref id="sysadmin-filesystems">
	  for details.

      <heading>Common tasks</heading>
        <sect1>
	  <heading>Adding new users</heading>
	  <p>
	  New users are usually added using the <prgn>adduser</prgn>
	  tool.  Typical syntax is <prgn>adduser
	  <var>username</var></prgn>, which will prompt the
	  administrator for various information such as the user's full
	  name, initial home directory, et cetera.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  There is also a <prgn>useradd</prgn> program, which predates
	  <prgn>adduser</prgn>.
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Changing or editing user information and settings</heading>
	  <p>
	  User information (such as the user's home directory location,
	  real name, etc) may be changed using the <prgn>usermod</prgn>
	  program.  The <prgn>chfn</prgn> program is intended
	  specifically for changing the "full name" and other contact
	  detail stored in the password file, while the
	  <prgn>chsh</prgn> command may be used to change a user's
	  default shell.
	  </p>
	  <p> 
	  You may also change user information by editing the
	  <file>/etc/passwd</file> file directly.  The best tool for
	  doing this is <prgn>vipw</prgn> program, which locks the file
	  and brings it up for editing in your favourite editor (as
	  found in the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables).
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Removing user accounts</heading>
	  <p>
	  User accounts can be removed using the <prgn>userdel</prgn>
	  command.
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Changing user passwords</heading>
	  <p>
	  The system administrator may change any user's password by
	  typing <prgn>passwd <var>username</var></prgn>.
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Setting and changing password expiry times</heading>
	  <p>
	  If you are using shadow passwords, you can set up the system
	  so that passwords expire after a certain number of days.  When
	  a password is due for expiry, the user is warned and must
	  change their password to avoid having their account locked or
	  disabled.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The tool used to set password expiry times is
	  <prgn>chage</prgn>.
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Creating groups</heading>
	  <p>
	  Groups may be created by using the <prgn>addgroup</prgn> tool.
	  Typical syntax for the <prgn>addgroup</prgn> command is
	  <prgn>addgroup <var>groupname</var></prgn>. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Administrators may also choose to add groups to the
	  <file>/etc/group</file> directly.  The best tool for doing
	  this is the <prgn>vigr</prgn> program, which locks the file
	  and brings it up for editing in your favourite editor (as
	  found in the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables).
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Editing groups</heading>
	  <p>
	  Groups may be edited using the <prgn>groupmod</prgn> tool.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Administrators may also choose to edit the
	  <file>/etc/group</file> directly.  The best tool for doing
	  this is the <prgn>vigr</prgn> program, which locks the file
	  and brings it up for editing in your favourite editor (as
	  found in the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables).
	  </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Deleting groups</heading>
	  <p>
	  Groups may be deleted using the <prgn>groupdel</prgn> tool.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Administrators may also choose to delete groups from the
	  <file>/etc/group</file> directly.  The best tool for doing
	  this is the <prgn>vigr</prgn> program, which locks the file
	  and brings it up for editing in your favourite editor (as
	  found in the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables).

	  <heading>Using shadow passwords</heading>
	  <p>
	  Shadow passwords can be turned on and off using the
	  <prgn>shadowconfig</prgn> tool.

	  <sect2>
	    <heading>adduser, addgroup</heading>
	    <p>
	    In the short form, these commands can be used by simply
	    typing <tt>adduser <var>username</var></tt> or <tt>addgroup
	    <var>groupname</var></tt>.  This provides an interactive
	    interface which will prompt the administrator for various
	    values, such as a user's home directory.
	    There are also a number of command line options
	    which can be used to specify these values.
	    <p>
	    See also <manref name="adduser" section="1">.

	  </sect2>
	  <sect2>
	    <heading>chfn</heading>
	    <p>
	    The <prgn>chfn</prgn> command may be used to change a user's
	    "full name" or other information stored in the password
	    file.  If no command line options are used, the command runs
	    in an interactive fashion, prompting for input for each
	    field.
	    <p>
	    See also <manref name="chfn" section="1">.
	    </p>
	  </sect2>
	  <sect2>
	    <heading>chsh</heading>
	    <p>
	    The basic syntax of the <prgn>chsh</prgn> command is
	    <tt>chsh -s <var>shell</var> <var>username</var></tt>.
	    However, if the <tt>-s</tt> parameter is omitted, the
	    administrator will be prompted for which shell to use.
	    The username is also optional: only the superuser may change
	    other users' shells; ordinary users may change their own
	    shell simply by typing <tt>chsh</tt>
	    <p>
	    See also <manref name="chsh" section="1">.
	    </p>
	  </sect2>
	  <sect2>
	    <heading>passwd</heading>
	    <p>
	    The basic form of the <prgn>passwd</prgn> command (as used
	    by the system administrator) is
	    <tt>passwd <var>username</var></tt>, which will prompt for
	    the user's new password.

	  <heading>/etc/shadow</heading>
	  <p>
	  If shadow passwords are being used, the <file>/etc/shadow</file> 
	  file contains users' encrypted passwords and other information
	  about the passwords.  Its fields are colon-separated as for
	  <file>/etc/passwd</file>, and are as follows:
	  </p>
	  <p><list>
	  <item>username
	  <item>encrypted password
	  <item>Days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last changed
          <item>Days before password may be changed
          <item>Days after which password must be changed
          <item>Days before password is to expire that user is warned
          <item>Days after password expires that account is disabled
          <item>Days since Jan 1, 1970 that account is disabled
          <item>A reserved field
	  </list></p>
