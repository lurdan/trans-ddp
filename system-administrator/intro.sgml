	<heading>About this manual</heading>
	<p>
	  The purpose of this manual is to help you to administer a Debian
	  GNU/Linux system.
        </p>
	<p>
	  Administration of any Unix machine is a complex task, that is
	  not to be learnt overnight.  Each setup is different, but there
	  are a number of tasks that every administrator has to perform.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This manual is intended to help you learn the basics of
	  administration, and to build on that to get the best out of your
	  machine for yourself and your users.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This manual assumes the reader is familiar with using a Unix
	  system and/or understands Debian User Reference
	  Manual. Additional reading for System Administrator is
	  Debian GNU/Linux Network Administrator's Manual. Both of
	  these are available from the Debian Documentation
	  Project. Another useful book is "Linux System
	  Administrator's Guide" by Lars Wirzenius, available from
	  Linux Documentation Project, http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/ .
