<heading>Why backup?</heading>
<p>Backups are needed in case a file or group of files is lost. The
      reasons for losing files include
<list>
<item>Hardware failure like disk breaking,
<item>computer being stolen and
<item>accidentally deleting wrong file.
</list>
</p>

<p>Backups help in all the above situation. In addition, it may be
good to have access older version of files, for example a
configuration file worked a week ago, but since the it has been
changed and nobody remembers how, its just not working anymore.
</p>

<p>There are other solutions, and they are good to have if you can
afford them. These include
<list>
<item>redundant disks (RAID 1 or 5), so that one disk can break
without loss of data,
<item>locking up computers,
<item>using an undelete system (or not making mistakes when deleting
files :-)
</list>
These help, but if there is anything you do not want to lose on the
computer, <strong>make sure there are backups and they can be
restored.</strong>

<heading>What to backup?</heading> 

<p>If there is room on the backup media, and time limits permit
running backups long enough, it probably is wisest to back up
everything. You may skip <prgn>/tmp</prgn> or other places where it is
known there are only temporary files that are nobody wants to
backup. </p>

<p>I space or time limits place restrictions, consider not backing up
the following:
<list>
<item>Files that come directly from a CD or other removable media. It
may even be fastar to copy them again from CD than restoring from
backup media. 
<item>Files that can be regenerated easily. For example, object files
that can be made with <prgn>make</prgn>. Just make sure all the source
files and compilers are backed up. 
<item>If the Internet connection is fast, it may be easy enough to
download files again. Just keep a list of the files and where to
download them from. 
</list></p>
