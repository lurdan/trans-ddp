<!-- Debian System Administration Manual - Time -->

      <heading>Time</heading>
      <p><email>Tapio.Lehtonen@IKI.FI</email></p>
Computers have a <strong>clock</strong> to keep time. Usually there is
a hardware clock with battery backup to keep time when the computer is
off. The operating system (for example Linux) runs it's own clock, and
from this clock comes the time shown by commands such as
<prgn>date</prgn> in linux and <prgn>time</prgn> in DOS. </p>

<p>The hardware clock is usually accurate enough, provided the battery
has not run out. If the computer shows way-off time when You turn it
on, it is worth checking if the battery still is usable. </p>

<p>The "software" clock usually has drift, either systematic or
random. This drift means the clock runs too fast or too slow. </p>

<p>To see the time on Debian Linux, use the command
<prgn>date</prgn>. For example
<example>
$ date
Fri Oct 23 04:45:51 EEST 1998
</example></p>

<p>The above command shows day of week, month, day of month, time, time
zone and year. The time zone also shows that Daylight Saving Time is in
use (time zone is EET, the extra S means Saving). </p>

<p>If You have root privileges, You can also change the time with
command <prgn>date</prgn>, see the man page <manref name="date"
section="1">. If You are connected to
the Internet or have other Unix computers on LAN, see section ??? for
easier ways to set time.</p>

<p>example of the confusing time strings???</pe>

<p>If You are running X Window, You may have a clock display somewhere
on the screen. If not, the command <prgn>xclock</prgn> probably is
installed and You can get an analog clock (with big hand, little hand, 
an optional seconds hand) or a digital clock (with <prgn>xclock
-digital</prgn>). See the man page <manref name="xclock" section="1">for more info.</p>

	<heading>Setting time, time zones and DST</heading>
        <p>
         When You installed Debian Linux, You set the <strong>Time
Zone</strong>. You can check how You have set the Time Zone by looking
at the file <prgn>/etc/timezone</prgn>. 
<example>
tale@dilbert /usr/doc/timezones
$ cat /etc/timezone
Europe/Helsinki
tale@dilbert /usr/doc/timezones
$ 
</example>
        /<p>

<p>Setting timezone after installation???</p> Setting TZ EV. 
<p>If the time zone is not set or is wrong, root can use the command
<prgn>tzconfig</prgn> to configure it after the operating system is
installed, see man page <manref name="tzconfig" section="8">. 

<p>If You do not have root privileges or want to set for Yourself a
different timezone than the system uses, You can set the environment
variable <prgn>TZ</prgn>. Use the command <prgn>tzselect</prgn> to
show what value to use for TZ. 

<p>The time zone is needed because Unix computers keep time in
<strong>Universal Time</strong> <strong>UTC</strong>, and local time
is calculated from this. UTC is local time in London, England. UTC was
previously called Greenwich Mean Time GMT. </p>

<p>UTC has no Daylight Saving Time or other changes, which makes it
easier to syncronize computer to the same time. The UTC is the same
everywhere, so it does not matter if two computers on different time
zones syncronize, if they both use UTC. </p>

<p>If You set Your Debian Linux computer to use local time, You do not
have to worry about time zones but then You also miss out on automatic
DST changes. In this document, it is assumed You set up Your computer
to use UTC. <p>

<p>If the Time Zone is correctly set up, and the time zone
configuration files are reasonably current, the local time shown by
the operating system changes to <strong>Daylight Saving Time</strong>
and back to normal time automatically on the correct dates. If the
time zone files You have are old, there may be problems because DST
start and end dates are not determined by a physical phenomenon, but
are chosen by some institution. Sometimes these dates are changed, for
example European Union changed the end date from last sunday in
september to last sunday in october in 1995. </p>

        <heading>Multiboot with operating systems not understanding time zone</heading>
        <p>
         If You have a multiboot configuration, where You have some
other operating system(s) on the same computer, and during boot choose
which one to start, You may get confused about the correct time. If
the other operating systems do not understand Time Zones, they think
UTC is the local time and show the wrong time (unless You live in
London, England or some other place in the same time zone). /<p>

<p>DOS, OS/2 and Windows except NT do not use time zones. If You <em>need</em>
to have the correct local time in these operating systems, You have to
set the clock to local time. Debian Linux can live with this, but it
is not recommended. </p>

        <heading>Syncing time, rdate and NTP</heading>
        <p>
         If You have another Unix computer which You know keeps the
correct time, with root privileges You can set the time with command
<prgn>rdate</prgn>. For example:
<example>
rdate <var>somehost.domain.com<var>
</example>
If You do not have an accurate time source, it is still a good idea to
set all Your computers to the same time, so You can compare time
stamps between hosts. </p>

<p>If You are connected to the Internet, You can install an NTP
client, for example <prgn>xntp3</prgn>. This uses the Network Time
Protocol RFC ??? to syncronize clocks to a few tens of milliseconds
precision. If You <em>need</need> this kind of precision or better, see also the
section Radio Clocks ???</p>

         Timestamps in files are in UTC. Can be compared between
separate computers provided clocks are synched.
