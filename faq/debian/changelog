          install it from a pile of floppy disks?"
        * getting.sgml: http://www.debian.org/CD is more up to date on
          getting CD images than this faq: add referral
        * pkg_basics.sgml: Mention wrapper tools for building .deb from

        * software.sgml: non-us is obsolete since sarge: remove section
        * getting.sgml: dselect's build-in access methods are obsolete. Do
          not talk about low level cd image details like Rock Ridge
          extensions: that's not suitable for newbies.
        * pkgtools.sgml: fix bug in description of "apt-get dist-upgrade".
          explain difference with "apt-get upgrade"
     - changes by joostvb, 2007-09-21

     - changes by joostvb, 2007-07-11
        * basic_defs.sgml: Michael K. Johnson's INFO-SHEET and META-FAQ have
          been unmaintained for a very long time. Refer to Linux Online instead.
        * basic_defs.sgml: We don't release every several months, but at
          about every 2 years (checked potato - woody - sarge - etch ( - lenny)
          release dates).  FTP archives are update twice, not once a day.
        * basic_defs.sgml: when asked what debian is, first tell about the
          nice things. explain the boring stuff like what a distribution is
          later: swapped 2 sections
        * support.sgml: remove notes about sections of manpages: too much
          techical detail for intented audience. give example "man ls"
          instead and refer to man(1)
        * support.sgml: mention yelp too, as an alternative for dwww,
          doc-central e.a.

doc-debian (3.1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Real update for imminent Sarge release, urgency high since this
    content needs to be updated to be available in the official
    CDs and DVDs:

      (Closes: #265587)
  * Use the wml files from a local www copy instead of the 'refresh'
    rule to make it easier to keep track of changes in the web pages
    No Build-Depends changes since the maintainer can simply 'make'
    the change happen if they have wml and lynx but it is not done
    automatically when built.

    before running 'make'

       packages (Closes: #309777)
     - nexxtime.sgml: Improvements to the next things for etch, not a full
       rewrite, but will do (Closes: #304130)
     - pkgtools.sgml and uptodate.sgml: The apt guide is now provided in 
       apt-doc. (Closes: #304156)
