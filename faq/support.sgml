<sect id="debiandocs">What other documentation exists on and for a
  Debian system?

<p><list>
  <item>Installation instructions for the current release:  see
    <url id="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install">.
  <item>Packaging manual is the primary documentation on the technical
    aspects of creating Debian binary and source packages.
    <p>You can find it in the <package/packaging-manual/ package, or at
    <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/packaging.html.tar.gz">.
  <item>Policy manual documents the policy requirements for the
    distribution, i.e. the structure and contents of the Debian archive,
    several design issues of the operating system, as well as technical
    requirements that each package must satisfy to be included in the
    distribution.
    <p>Get it from the <package/debian-policy/ package, or at
    <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/policy.html.tar.gz">.
  <item>Documentation on installed Debian packages:
    Most packages have files that are unpacked into <tt>/usr/doc/PACKAGE</tt>.
  <item>Documentation on the Linux project:
    The Debian package <tt>doc-linux</tt> installs all of the most recent
    versions of the HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs from the <url name="Linux
    Documentation Project" id="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/">.
  <item>Unix-style `man' pages:  Most commands have manual pages written in
    the style of the original Unix 'man' files. They are referenced by the
    section of the 'man' directory where they reside: e.g., foo(3) refers
    to a manual page which resides in /usr/share/man/man3/, and it can be
    called by executing the command: <tt>man 3 foo</tt>, or just
    <tt>man foo</tt> if section 3 is the first one containing a page on
    <tt>foo</tt>.
    <p>One can learn which directory of <tt>/usr/share/man/</tt> contains
    a certain manual page by executing <tt>man -w foo</tt>.
    <p>New Debian users should note that the 'man' pages of many general
    system commands are not available until they install these packages:
    <list>
      <item><tt>man-db</tt>, which contains the <tt>man</tt> program
        itself, and other programs for manipulating the manual pages.
      <item><tt>manpages</tt>, which contains the system manual pages.
        (see <ref id="nonenglish">).
    </list>
  <item>GNU-style `info' pages:  User documentation for many commands,
    particularly GNU tools, is available not in `man' pages, but in `info'
    files which can be read by the GNU tool <tt>info</tt>, by running
    <tt>M-x info</tt> within GNU Emacs, or with some other Info page viewer.
    <p>Its main advantage over the original `man' pages are that it is
    a hypertext system.  It does <em>not</em> require the WWW, however;
    <tt>info</tt> can be run from a plain text console.  It was designed
    by Richard Stallman and preceded the WWW.
</list>

<p>Note that you may access a lot of documentation on your system by using a
WWW browser, through `dwww' or `dhelp' commands, found in respective
packages.

<sect id="onlineresources">Are there any on-line resources for discussing
  Debian?

<p>There are a lot of Debian-related mailing lists.

<p>On a system with the <tt>doc-debian</tt> package installed there
is a complete list of mailing lists in the file <tt><url
id="file:/usr/share/doc/debian/mailing-lists.txt"
name="/usr/share/doc/debian/mailing-lists.txt"></tt>.

<p>To subscribe to debian-X (for X in announce, user, etc.), send mail to
debian-X-request@lists.debian.org with the word "subscribe" in the Subject:
header. If you have a forms-capable World Wide Web browser, you can
subscribe the mailing lists using the <url name="WWW form"
id="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe.html">.
You can also un-subscribe using that form.

<p>The list manager's e-mail address is <email/listmaster@lists.debian.org/, in
case you have any trouble.

<p>Archives of the Debian mailing lists are available via WWW at
<url id="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/">.

<p>Users can address questions to individual package maintainers, since
their e-mail addresses are provided in the Debian control file (see section
<ref id="controlfile">) that is included within each package.  One can also
learn the maintainers' names and e-mail addresses by searching the
"Packages" file, since this file is just a concatenation of all the available
package control files in a particular directory tree. To extract a control
file from a particular Debian package, use the command,
<example>
dpkg --info packageName_VVV-RRR.deb
</example>

<p>Users should post non-Debian-specific questions to one of the Linux
USENET groups, which are named comp.os.linux.* or linux.*.  Specialized
Systems Consultants (a.k.a. SSC) maintains a <url name="list of newsgroups"
id="http://www.ssc.com/linux/news.html"> about Linux, Unix, X, and
networking, on their WWW site.

<sect id="mailinglistconduct">What is the code of conduct for the mailing
  lists?

<p>When using the Debian mailing lists, please follow these rules:

<list>
  <item>Do not flame; it is not polite.  Besides the people developing
    Debian are all volunteers, donating their time, energy and money in
    an attempt to bring the Debian project together.
  <item>Do not use foul language; besides, some people receive the lists
    via packet radio, where swear words are illegal.
  <item>Make sure that you are using the proper list. <em/Never/ post
    (un)subscription requests to the mailing list itself, please.
  <item>Do not try posting unless you are subscribed.  Posting by
    non-subscribers to some list was turned off to make the mailing lists
    usable. Thus, only postings from e-mail addresses matching those of
    a subscriber are accepted. If you often post from other addresses than
    the one you subscribe with, mail the list manager
    <email/listmaster@lists.debian.org/ with the subject "please add
    subscriber alias".
  <item>See section <ref id="bugreport"> for notes on reporting bugs.
</list>

<sect1 id="advertising">Mailing list advertising policy

<p>The &debian; mailing lists accept commercial advertising for payment.
We offer a fee waiver if you can show us the cancelled check for a
&dollar;1000 (U.S.) or more donation to the Free Software Foundation
earmarked for "Debian". One donation per advertisement, please. If you
do not wish to donate, simply post your advertisement to the list, and
the operator of the mailing lists will bill &dollar;1999 (U.S). The list
operator will donate this amount, minus the expense of collecting it,
to FSF.

<p>By the act of posting your advertisement you agree to accept
responsibility for the fee, you agree to indemnify the mailing-list
operator against any legal claims from you or others in connection with
your advertisement, and you agree to pay any legal and business
expenses incurred in collecting late payment. Our liability to you is
limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your message.

<p>Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements. You must consult the mailing-list operator in advance
of posting for any reduction or fee waiver.

<sect id="searchtools">Is there a quick way to search for information on
  &debian;?

<p>There are a variety of search engines that serve documentation related
to Debian:

<list>
  <item><url id="http://www.debian.org/search" name="Debian WWW search site">.
  <!-- the above URL isn't working right now, but will, hopefully soon -->
  <item><url id="http://www.dejanews.com/" name="DejaNews news search service">.
    To find out what experiences people have had with finding drivers for
    Western Digital controllers, try searching on this phrase:
    <example>
    linux & WD
    </example>
    This tells DejaNews to report any postings containing both the
    string "linux" AND the string "WD".
    (as a side note: when one of the authors of this text used it, he
    discovered that his WD card (which he had only had for 6 months) had
    been declared outmoded by Adaptec, because they bought WD then.
    So there were no drivers available. Bless Adaptec's hearts.)
  <item>The <url id="http://altavista.digital.com/" name="AltaVista Search
    Engine"> can also be used to search Usenet (although it appears to be
    not quite as up to date as DejaNews).
    <p>For example, searching on the string "cgi-perl" gives a more detailed
    explanation of this package than the brief description field in its
    control file.
