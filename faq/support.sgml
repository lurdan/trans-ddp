<sect id="debiandocs">What other documentation exists on and for a
  Debian system?

<p><list>
  <item>Installation instructions for the current release:  see
    <url id="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install">.
  <item>Packaging manual is the primary documentation on the technical
    aspects of creating Debian binary and source packages.
    <p>You can find it in the <package/packaging-manual/ package, or at
    <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/packaging.html.tar.gz">.
  <item>Policy manual documents the policy requirements for the
    distribution, i.e. the structure and contents of the Debian archive,
    several design issues of the operating system, as well as technical
    requirements that each package must satisfy to be included in the
    distribution.
    <p>Get it from the <package/debian-policy/ package, or at
    <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/policy.html.tar.gz">.
  <item>Documentation on installed Debian packages:
    Most packages have files that are unpacked into <tt>/usr/doc/PACKAGE</tt>.
  <item>Documentation on the Linux project:
    The Debian package <package/doc-linux/ installs all of the most recent
    versions of the HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs from the <url name="Linux
    Documentation Project" id="http://www.linuxdoc.org">.
  <item>Unix-style `man' pages:  Most commands have manual pages written in
    the style of the original Unix 'man' files. They are referenced by the
    section of the 'man' directory where they reside: e.g., foo(3) refers
    to a manual page which resides in /usr/share/man/man3/, and it can be
    called by executing the command: <tt>man 3 foo</tt>, or just
    <tt>man foo</tt> if section 3 is the first one containing a page on
    <tt>foo</tt>.
    <p>One can learn which directory of <tt>/usr/share/man/</tt> contains
    a certain manual page by executing <tt>man -w foo</tt>.
    <p>New Debian users should note that the 'man' pages of many general
    system commands are not available until they install these packages:
    <list>
      <item><tt>man-db</tt>, which contains the <tt>man</tt> program
        itself, and other programs for manipulating the manual pages.
      <item><tt>manpages</tt>, which contains the system manual pages.
        (see <ref id="nonenglish">).
    </list>
  <item>GNU-style `info' pages:  User documentation for many commands,
    particularly GNU tools, is available not in `man' pages, but in `info'
    files which can be read by the GNU tool <tt>info</tt>, by running
    <tt>M-x info</tt> within GNU Emacs, or with some other Info page viewer.
    <p>Its main advantage over the original `man' pages are that it is
    a hypertext system.  It does <em>not</em> require the WWW, however;
    <tt>info</tt> can be run from a plain text console.  It was designed
    by Richard Stallman and preceded the WWW.
</list>

<p>Note that you may access a lot of documentation on your system by using a
WWW browser, through `dwww' or `dhelp' commands, found in respective
packages.

<sect id="onlineresources">Are there any on-line resources for discussing
  Debian?

<p>Yes. In fact, the main method of support Debian provides to our users is
by the way of email.

<sect1>Mailing lists

<p>There are a lot of <url name="Debian-related mailing lists"
id="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/">.

<p>On a system with the <package/doc-debian/ package installed there
is a complete list of mailing lists in
<file>/usr/share/doc/debian/mailing-lists.txt</file>.

<p>To subscribe to debian-X (for X in announce, user, etc.), send mail to
debian-X-request@lists.debian.org with the word "subscribe" in the Subject:
header. If you have a forms-capable World Wide Web browser, you can
subscribe the mailing lists using the <url name="WWW form"
id="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe">.
You can also un-subscribe using a <url name="WWW form"
id="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/unsubscribe">.

<p>The list manager's e-mail address is <email/listmaster@lists.debian.org/, in
case you have any trouble.

<p>Archives of the Debian mailing lists are available via WWW at
<url id="http://lists.debian.org/">.

<sect2 id="mailinglistconduct">What is the code of conduct for the mailing
  lists?

<p>When using the Debian mailing lists, please follow these rules:

<list>
  <item>Do not send spam. See the <url name="Debian mailing list
    advertising policy" id="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/#ads">.
  <item>Do not flame; it is not polite. The people developing Debian are
    all volunteers, donating their time, energy and money in an attempt to
    bring the Debian project together.
  <item>Do not use foul language; besides, some people receive the lists
    via packet radio, where swearing is illegal.
  <item>Make sure that you are using the proper list. <em/Never/ post your
    (un)subscription requests to the mailing list itself<footnote>Use the
    <em>listname</em>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org address for that.</footnote>
  <item>See section <ref id="bugreport"> for notes on reporting bugs.
</list>

<sect1>Maintainers

<p>Users can address questions to individual package maintainers using
email. To reach a maintainer of a package called xyz, send email to
<em>xyz@packages.debian.org</em>.

<sect1>Usenet newsgroups

<p>Users should post non-Debian-specific questions to one of the Linux
USENET groups, which are named comp.os.linux.* or linux.*.
There are several lists of Linux Usenet newsgroups and other related
resources on the WWW, e.g. on the <url name="Linux Online"
id="http://www.linux.org/docs/usenet.html"> and <url name="LinuxJournal"
id="http://www.linuxjournal.com/help/online.html"> sites.

<sect id="searchtools">Is there a quick way to search for information on
  &debian;?

<p>There are a variety of search engines that serve documentation related
to Debian:

<list>
  <item><url id="http://www.debian.org/search" name="Debian WWW search site">.
    <!-- the above URL isn't working right now, but will, hopefully soon -->
  <item><url id="http://www.dejanews.com/" name="DejaNews news search service">.
    To find out what experiences people have had with finding drivers for
    Western Digital controllers, try searching on this phrase:
    <tt>linux & WD</tt>
    This tells DejaNews to report any postings containing both the
    string "linux" AND the string "WD".
    (as a side note: when one of the authors of this text used it, he
    discovered that his WD card (which he had only had for 6 months) had
    been declared outmoded by Adaptec, because they bought WD then.
    So there were no drivers available. Bless Adaptec's hearts.)
  <item>Any of the web spidering engines (such as
    <url id="http://www.altavista.com/" name="AltaVista"> or
    <url id="http://www.google.com" name="Google">)
    can also be used to search Usenet (although they may not be quite as up
    to date as DejaNews).
    <p>For example, searching on the string "cgi-perl" gives a more detailed
    explanation of this package than the brief description field in its
    control file.
</list>

<sect id="buglogs">Are there logs of known bugs?

<p>The &debian; distribution has a bug tracking system (BTS) which files
details of bugs reported by users and developers. Each bug is given a
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with.

<p>Copies of this information are available at
<url id="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">.

<p>A mail server provides access to the bug tracking system database via
e-mail.  In order to get the instructions, send an e-mail to
request@bugs.debian.org with "help" in the body.

<sect id="bugreport">How do I report a bug in Debian?

<p>If you have found a bug in Debian, please read the instructions for
reporting a bug in Debian.  These instructions can be obtained in one of
several ways:
<list>
  <item>By anonymous FTP.  Debian mirror sites contain the instructions in
  the file <tt>doc/bug-reporting.txt</tt>.
  <item>From the WWW.  A copy of the instructions is shown at
  <url id="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting">.
  <item>On any Debian system with the <package/doc-debian/ package installed.
  The instructions are in the file
  <file>/usr/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt</file>.
</list>

<p>You can use the packages <package/bug/ or <package/reportbug/ that will
guide you through the reporting process and mail the message to the proper
address, with some extra details about your system added automatically.

<p>If you want to mail the report with a MUA, send a message to
<email/submit@bugs.debian.org/, first line of which containing a line like
  <example>Package: packagename</example>
(replace "packagename" with the name of the package). The rest of the
message should contain the description of the bug (please make it moderately
detailed), Debian release you are using, and versions of that and relevant
packages.

<p>Expect to get an automatic acknowledgement of your bug report. It will
also be automatically given a bug tracking number, entered into the bug
log and forwarded to the debian-bugs-dist mailing list.

<p>If one were to identify a bug that was common to many programs, then
rather than entering dozens of very similar bug reports, one might prefer to
send individual bugs to <email/maintonly@bugs.debian.org/ (instead of the
submit@... address) to reach only the respective package maintainers, and
then send a summary report to debian-devel and/or debian-bugs-dist mailing
lists.

<p>Additionally, there exists a Debian package checker, called
<url name="Lintian" id="http://www.debian.org/lintian/">, which is
designed to mechanically check Debian packages for policy violations and
common packaging errors. Thus, if you detect a bug in a package which is
likely to appear in other packages too, it might be better to get in
contact with the Lintian maintainers at <email/lintian-maint@debian.org/
so that a new check is written for Lintian instead of reporting the bug
directly. This will most likely prevent the bug to appear in future versions
of the package again, or in any other package of the distribution.

<p>You can also use <email/quiet@bugs.debian.org/, to submit bug reports to
the BTS only, without having them sent either to debian-bugs-dist or to the
maintainer. This `quiet' address is used very rarely, e.g. when you want to
send some minor data to your report, that should just be recorded in the
log, or when you want to record something in the BTS log but you already
sent it to the maintainer.
