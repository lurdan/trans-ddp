<!-- XXX update for new distros -->

<sect id="security">Increased security

<p>Debian contains support for shadow passwords since release 1.3. In
addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules (a.k.a.
<url name="libpam" id="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">;) that
allows sysadmins to choose authorization modes on an application-specific
basis is available, and initially set to authenticate via shadow password.

<p>Including full support for 
additional security enhancements for mandatory access
control mechanisms such as SElinux, RSBAC and buffer overflow protection
like Exec-shield or PaX is still in progress.

<sect id="i18n">Extended support for non-English users

<p>Debian already has very good support for non-English users, see
<ref id="nonenglish">.

<p>We hope to find people who will provide support for even more languages,
and translate. Some programs already support internationalization, so we
need message catalogs translators. Many programs still remain to be
properly internationalized.

<p>The GNU Translation Project <url id="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS">
works on internationalizing the GNU programs.

<p>Specifically for Debian lenny, we're working on things like the following:

 <list>
  <item>I18n support in all debconf-using packages: Packages using the Debian
configuration management must allow for translation of all messages displayed
to the user during package configuration.
  <item>I18n support for package descriptions: Update package management
frontends to use the translated descriptions of packages.
  <item>UTF-8 debian/changelog and debian/control.  This way, e.g. names of
people from asian countries can get typeset the right way in changelogs.
 </list>


<sect id="morearches">More architectures

<p>Complete Debian system on other architectures such as <url
id="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort" name="ARM EABI"> (referred to as
"armel") (next to the old "arm") will likely get supported with lenny.  Support
for <url id="http://wiki.debian.org/SHPort" name="SuperH"> is expected soon.
Notice that even though some architectures are dropped for a given the release
there still might be a way to install and upgrade using the latest
<tt>sid</tt>.

<sect id="morekernels">More kernels

<p>In addition to Debian GNU/Hurd, Debian is being ported also to BSD kernels,
namely to <url id="http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/" name="FreeBSD">.
This port runs on both AMD64 ("kfreebsd-amd64") and traditional Intel
("kfreebsd-i386").
