<chapt id="future">What kind of changes should I expect to see in the next
  major release of &debian;?

<sect id="security">Increased security

<P>Debian contains shadow passwords password since release 1.3.

<P>In addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules
(<url id="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">;
a.k.a. <tt>libpam</tt>) that allow sysadmins to choose authorization modes
on an application-specific basis is available, and initially set to
authenticate via shadow password.

<sect id="i18n">More Support for non-English users

<p>Debian already has some support for non-English users, see
<ref id="nonenglish">. We hope to find people who provide support for even
more languages.

<p>Some programs already support internationalization, so we need message
catalogs. Many programs still must be internationalized.

<p>The GNU Translation Project <url id="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS">
works on internationalizing the GNU programs.

<sect id="morearches">More architectures

<p>Currently a complete Debian release is available for the Intel x86 (i386),
Motorola 680x0 (m68k), Alpha (alpha), and SPARC (sparc) architectures.
&debian; 2.2 is expected to include complete support for the
PowerPC (powerpc) architecture.

<p>Complete Debian system on other architectures is expected soon.

<sect id="newkernel">Linux 2.2

<p>&debian; 2.2 will be the first release that will by default install
the latest version of the stable Linux kernel, version 2.2.x.

<p>Of course, it will still include packages for and contain support for
Linux 2.0.x.

<sect id="libc">glibc 2.1

<p>&debian; 2.2 will be the first release to include the latest
stable GNU LibC library, version 2.1.x (which was already being used
in <tt>slink</tt> by some of the non-Intel architectures).
