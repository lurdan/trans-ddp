<chapt id="nexttime">What kind of changes should I expect to see in the next
  major release of &debian;?

<sect id="security">Increased security

<p>Debian contains support for shadow passwords since release 1.3. In
addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules (a.k.a.
<url name="libpam" id="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">;) that
allow sysadmins to choose authorization modes on an application-specific
basis is available, and initially set to authenticate via shadow password.

<p>Including full support for advanced authentication methods such as
Kerberos, RSBAC and others is in progress.

<sect id="i18n">Extended support for non-English users

<p>Debian already has some support for non-English users, see
<ref id="nonenglish">.

<p>We hope to find people who will provide support for even more languages,
and translate. Some programs already support internationalization, so we
need message catalogs translators. Many programs still remaint to be
properly internationalized.

<p>The GNU Translation Project <url id="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS">
works on internationalizing the GNU programs.

<sect id="morearches">More architectures

<p>Currently a complete Debian release is available for the Intel x86 (i386),
Motorola 680x0 (m68k), Alpha (alpha), and SPARC (sparc) architectures.
&debian; 2.2 is expected to include complete support for PowerPC (powerpc)
and ARM (arm) architectures.

<p>Complete Debian system on other architectures is expected soon.

<sect id="newkernel">Linux kernel 2.2

<p>&debian; 2.2 will be the first release that will by default install
the latest version of the stable Linux kernel, version 2.2.x.

<p>Of course, it will still include packages for and contain support for
Linux 2.0.x.

<sect id="glibc2.1">The GNU C Library 2.1

<p>&debian; 2.2 will be the first release to include the latest
stable GNU LibC library, version 2.1.x (which was already being used
in <tt>slink</tt> by some of the non-Intel architectures).
