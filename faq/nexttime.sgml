<chapt id="nexttime">What kind of changes should I expect to see in the next
  major release of &debian;?

<!-- XXX update for new distros -->

<sect id="security">Increased security

<p>Debian contains support for shadow passwords since release 1.3. In
addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules (a.k.a.
<url name="libpam" id="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">;) that
allows sysadmins to choose authorization modes on an application-specific
basis is available, and initially set to authenticate via shadow password.

<p>Including full support for advanced authentication methods such as
Kerberos, RSBAC and others is in progress.

<sect id="i18n">Extended support for non-English users

<p>Debian already has some support for non-English users, see
<ref id="nonenglish">.

<p>We hope to find people who will provide support for even more languages,
and translate. Some programs already support internationalization, so we
need message catalogs translators. Many programs still remain to be
properly internationalized.

<p>The GNU Translation Project <url id="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS">
works on internationalizing the GNU programs.

<sect id="morearches">More architectures

<p>Complete Debian system on other architectures such as SPARC64 or SuperH
is expected soon.

<sect id="morekernels">More kernels

<p>In addition to Debian GNU/Hurd, Debian is being ported to several BSD
kernels, namely those from NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
