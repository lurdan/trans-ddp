<chapt id="nexttime">Changes expected in the next major release of Debian

<!-- XXX update for new distros -->

<sect id="security">Increased security

<p>Debian contains support for shadow passwords since release 1.3. In
addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules (a.k.a.
<url name="libpam" id="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">;) that
allows sysadmins to choose authorization modes on an application-specific
basis is available, and initially set to authenticate via shadow password.

<p>Including full support for advanced authentication methods such as
Kerberos, as well as additional security enhancements for mandatory access
control mechanisms such as SElinux, RSBAC and buffer overflow protection
like Exec-shield or PaX is still in progress.

<sect id="i18n">Extended support for non-English users

<p>Debian already has very good support for non-English users, see
<ref id="nonenglish">.

<p>We hope to find people who will provide support for even more languages,
and translate. Some programs already support internationalization, so we
need message catalogs translators. Many programs still remain to be
properly internationalized.

<p>The GNU Translation Project <url id="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS">
works on internationalizing the GNU programs.

<sect id="morearches">More architectures

<p>Complete Debian system on other architectures such as AMD64 or SuperH
is expected soon. Notice that, for AMD64 there is a development
archive at <url id="http://amd64.debian.net/"> that provides intallation
images as well as binary packages for most of the distribution. This
architecture will probably be added for <tt>etch</tt>.

<sect id="morekernels">More kernels

<p>In addition to Debian GNU/Hurd, Debian is being ported also to
BSD kernels, namely to 
<url id="http://www.debian.org/ports/netbsd" name="NetBSD">.
