<chapt id="software">Software available in the Debian system

<sect id="apps">What types of applications and development software are
  available for &debian;?

<p>Like most Linux distributions, &debian; provides:
<list>
  <item>the major GNU applications for software development, file
    manipulation, and text processing, including gcc, g++, make, texinfo,
    Emacs, the Bash shell and numerous upgraded Unix utilities,
  <item>Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and various related programs, modules and
    libraries for each of them,
  <item>TeX (LaTeX) and Lyx, dvips, Ghostscript,
  <item>the X Window System, which provides a networked graphical user
    interface for Linux, and countless X applications including GNOME
    and KDE.
  <item>a full suite of networking applications, including servers for
    Internet protocols such as HTTP (WWW), FTP, NNTP (news), SMTP and POP
    (mail) and name server; also provided are web browsers, and
    development tools.
</list>

<p>More than &main-pkgs; packages, ranging from news servers and readers
to sound support, FAX programs, database and spreadsheet programs, image
processing programs, communications, net, and mail utilities, Web servers,
and even ham-radio programs are included in the distribution.
Another &contrib-nonfree-pkgs; software suites are available as Debian
packages, but are not formally part of Debian due to license restrictions.

<sect id="softwareauthors">Who wrote all that software?

<p>For each package the <em>authors</em> of the program(s) are credited in
the file <tt>/usr/doc/PACKAGE/copyright</tt>, where PACKAGE is to be
substituted with the package's name.

<p><em>Maintainers</em> who package this software for the &debian; system
are listed in the Debian control file (see <ref id="controlfile">) that
comes with each package.

<sect id="pkglist">How can I get a current list of programs that have been
  packaged for Debian?

<p>A complete list is available in two parts:
<taglist>
  <tag>the list of packages that can be distributed everywhere
     <item>from any of the <url name="Debian mirrors"
           id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist">, in the file
           <tt>indices/Maintainers</tt>.
           That file includes the package names and the names and e-mails
           of their respective maintainers.
  <tag>the list of packages that cannot be exported from the US
     <item>from any of the <url name="Debian non-US mirrors"
           id="http://www.debian.org/misc/README.non-US">, in the file
           <tt>indices-non-US/Maintainers</tt>.
           That file includes the package names and the names and e-mails
           of their respective maintainers.
</taglist>

<p>The <url name="WWW interface to the Debian packages"
id="http://packages.debian.org/"> conveniently summarizes the packages
in each of about twenty "sections" of the Debian archive.

<sect id="missing">What is missing from &debian;?

<p>A list of packages which are still needed to be packaged for Debian
exists, the <url id="http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/" name="Work-Needing
and Prospective Packages list">.

<p>For more details about adding the missing things, see <ref id="contrib">.

<sect id="no-devs">Why do I get "ld: cannot find -lfoo" messages when
  compiling programs? Why aren't there any libfoo.so files in Debian library
  packages?

<p>Debian Policy requires that such symbolic links (to libfoo.so.x.y.z or
similar) are placed in separate, development packages. Those packages are
usually named libfoo-dev or libfooX-dev (presuming the library package is
named libfooX, and X is a whole number).

<sect id="java">(How) Does Debian support Java?

<p>Since the official Java Development kit and Runtime Environment from Sun
icrosystems is non-free software, even undistributeable by Debian, it cannot
properly be included in Debian. If you want those installed anyway, please
refer to the <package/java-package/ package in contrib.

<p>However, both the JDK and several <em>free</em> implementations of
Java technology are available as Debian packages. You can write, debug
and run Java programs using Debian.

<p>Running a Java applet requires a web browser with the capability to
recognize and execute them. Several web browsers available in Debian, such
as Mozilla or Konqueror, support Java plug-ins that enable running Java
applets within them. Netscape Navigator, while non-free, is also available
as a Debian package and it can run Java applets.

<p>Please refer to the <url name="Debian Java FAQ"
id="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-java-faq/"> for more
information.

<sect id="isitdebian">How can I check that I am using a Debian system, and
  what version is it?

<p>In order to make sure that your system has been installed from the
real Debian base disks check for the existence of
<tt>/etc/debian_version</tt> file, which contains a single one-line entry
giving the version number of the release, as defined by the package
<tt>base-files</tt>.

<p>The existence of the program <tt>dpkg</tt> shows that you should be able
to install Debian packages on your system, but as the program has been
ported to many other operating systems and architectures, this is no longer
a reliable method of determining is a system &debian;.

<p>Users should be aware, however, that the Debian system consists of many
parts, each of which can be updated (almost) independently. Each Debian
"release" contains well defined and unchanging contents.  Updates are
separately available.  For a one-line description of the installation status
of package <tt>foo</tt>, use the command <tt>dpkg --list foo</tt>.
To view versions of all installed packages, run:
  <example>dpkg -l</example>
For a more verbose description, use:
  <example>dpkg --status foo</example>

<sect id="nonenglish">How does Debian support non-English languages?

<p><list>
  <item>&debian; is distributed with keymaps for nearly two dozen
    keyboards, and with utilities (in the <tt>kbd</tt> package) to install,
    view, and modify the tables.
    <p>The installation prompts the user to specify the keyboard he will use.
  <item>Vast majority of the software we packaged supports entering
    non-US-ASCII characters used in other Latin languages (e.g. ISO-8859-1
    or ISO-8859-2), and a number of programs support multi-byte languages
    such as Japanese or Chinese.
  <item>Currently, support for German-, Spanish-, Finnish-, French-,
    Hungarian-, Italian-, Japanese-, Korean- and Polish-language
    manual pages is provided through the <tt>manpages-LANG</tt> packages
    (where LANG is the two-letter ISO country code). To access an NLS manual
    page, the user must set the shell LC_MESSAGES variable to the appropriate
    string.
    <p>For example, in the case of the Italian-language manual pages,
    LC_MESSAGES needs to be set to 'italian'.  The <prgn/man/ program will
    then search for Italian manual pages under <tt>/usr/share/man/it/</tt>.
</list>

<sect id="usexports">What about the US export regulation limitations?

<p>US laws place restrictions on the export of defense articles, which
includes some types of cryptographic software. PGP and ssh, among others,
fall into this category.

<p>To prevent anyone from taking unnecessary legal risks, certain Debian
GNU/Linux packages are only available from a non-US site
<url id="ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/">. There are numerous
mirror sites all of which are also outside of the US, see
<url id="ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/README.non-US"> for a full
list.

<sect id="pine">Where is pine?

<p>Due to its restrictive license, it's in the non-free area. Moreover,
since license does not even allow modified binaries to be distributed,
you have to compile it yourself from the source and the Debian patches.

<p>The source package name is <package/pine/. You can use the
<package/pine-tracker/ package to be notified about when you need to
upgrade.

<p>Note that there are many replacements for both pine and pico, such as
<package/mutt/ and <package/nano/, that are located in the main section.
