<chapt id="software">Software available in the Debian system

<sect id="apps">What types of applications and development software are
  available for &debian;?

<p>Like most Linux distributions, &debian; provides:
<list>
  <item>the major GNU applications for software development, file
  manipulation, and text processing, including gcc, libc, g++, make,
  texinfo, the Bash shell and numerous upgraded Unix utilities,
  <item>Perl and its libraries,
  <item>TeX, LaTeX, and dvips,
  <item>the X Window System, which provides a networked graphical user
    interface for Linux, and numerous X applications,
  <item>a full suite of other networking applications, including WWW servers,
    browsers, and development tools.
</list>

<p>More than &main-pkgs; packages, ranging from news servers and readers
to sound support, FAX programs, database and spreadsheet programs, image
processing programs, communications, net, and mail utilities, Web servers,
and even ham-radio programs are included in the distribution.
Another &nonfree-contrib-pkgs; software suites are available as Debian
packages, but are not formally part of Debian due to license restrictions.

<sect id="softwareauthors">Who wrote all that software?

<p><list>
  <item>For each package the <em>authors</em> of this program are
  credited in the file <tt>/usr/doc/PACKAGE/copyright</tt>, where
  PACKAGE is to be substituted with the package's name.

  <item><em>Maintainers</em> who package this software for the &debian;
  system are listed in the Debian control file (see <ref id="controlfile">)
  that comes with each package.
</list>

<sect id="pkglist">How can I get a current list of programs that have been
  packaged for the Debian project?

<p>A complete list is available from any of the Debian <url name="mirrors"
id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">.

<p>The file <tt>indices/Packages-Master-i386.gz</tt> provides a list,
including short descriptions, of all packages that are available for
computers with ix86 (and compatible) chips.
There are similar files, at <tt>indices/Packages-Master-ARCH.gz</tt>, where
ARCH is to be substituted by the appropriate architecture, that provide a
similar list of packages that are available for such computers/architectures.

<p>The <url name="WWW interface to the Debian packages"
id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages.html"> conveniently summarizes
the packages in each of about twenty "sections" of the Debian archive.

<sect id="missing">What is missing from &debian;?

<p>A list of packages which are still needed to be packaged for Debian
exists, the "Work-Needing and Prospective Packages" list. For more details,
see <ref id="contrib">.

<sect id="java">(How) Does Debian support Java?

<p>The Java Development Kit from Sun is currently available as a Debian
package (<tt>jdkVVV_VVV-RRR.deb</tt>).  The JDK will allow you to run
Java programs and applets, and write your own.  If your kernel is
properly configured (see below), the JDK will allow you to <em>run</em>
Java programs just like other executables.  The JDK package also includes
a number of demo programs.

<p>
<!-- XXX general "how to load a module" section ? -->
Debian's kernel is configured with Java support built in as a module (i.e.,
CONFIG_BINFMT_JAVA=m).  Users who wish to build their own custom kernel
(see <ref id="custker">) can of course omit this if
they choose.  Once module support is available in the kernel, you
need to make sure the module is loaded.  You can do it at boot time
by inserting the line <tt>binfmt_java</tt> in the file
<tt>/etc/modules</tt>.
Alternatively, you can install the module from the command line by
executing the command <tt>insmod DIRNAME/binfmt_java.o</tt> where
<tt>DIRNAME</tt> is the name of the directory where the modules that
have been built for the version of the kernel now running are stored.
On a system with the 2.2.14 version of the kernel,
<tt>DIRNAME</tt> is likely to be <tt>/lib/modules/2.2.14/fs/</tt>.
You can check that a module is loaded using the command
<tt>lsmod</tt>.

<p>Running a Java applet requires a browser with the capability to
recognize and execute them.  The Netscape browser that can be installed
as a Debian package will run Java applets.  (The Netscape source code
is not publicly available.  The Debian netscape package provides
a wrapper which aids the installation and management of Netscape on
a Debian system.  This is actually a good example of the integration
of commercial packages with the Debian system.)

<!--
META:  Check whether/how Netscape can run Java programs.
-->

<p>A final note of mixed blessings:
Sun's licensing policies on the JDK are becoming more restricted with time,
so this package may not be available as part of Debian soon.
It is possible that it may be available in the same way that Netscape is
available for &debian;.  Better news is that a number of programs are
currently being developed with may provide attractive publicly-available
alternatives.

<sect id="pine">Where is pine?

<p>Due to its restrictive license, it's in the non-free area. Moreover,
since license does not even allow modified binaries to be distributed,
you have to compile it yourself from the source and the Debian patches.
For the convenience of people using dselect, the source code for the Debian
version of pine is available in the packages <package/pine396-src/ and
<package/pine396-diffs/, or <package/pine4-src/ and <package/pine4-diffs/
for version 4.*.

<sect id="isitdebian">How can I check that I am using a Debian system, and
  what version of it?

<p>In order to make sure that your system has been installed from the
real Debian base disks check for the existence of
<tt>/etc/debian_version</tt> file, which contains a single one-line entry
giving the version number of the release, as defined by the package
<tt>base-files</tt>.

<p>The existence of the program <tt>dpkg</tt> shows that you should be able
to install Debian packages on your system, but as the program has been
ported to many other operating systems and architectures, this is no longer
a reliable method of determining is a system &debian;.

<p>Users should be aware, however, that the Debian system consists of many
parts, each of which can be updated (almost) independently. Each Debian
"release" contains well defined and unchanging contents.  Updates are
separately available.  For a one-line description of the installation status
of package <tt>foo</tt>, use the command <tt>dpkg --list foo</tt>.
(The command <example>dpkg -l</example> command prints out versions of all
installed packages.)  For a more verbose description, use
<example>dpkg --status foo</example>.

<sect id="nonenglish">How does Debian support non-English languages?

<p><list>
  <item>&debian; is distributed with keymaps for nearly two dozen
    keyboards, and with utilities (in the <tt>kbd</tt> package) to install,
    view, and modify the tables.
    <p>The installation prompts the user to specify the keyboard he will use.
  <item>Vast majority of the software we packaged supports entering
    non-US-ASCII characters used in other Latin languages (e.g. ISO-8859-1
    or ISO-8859-2), and some of the programs even support multi-byte
    languages such as Japanese or Chinese.
  <item>Support for French-, German-, Italian-, Spanish- and Polish-language
    manual pages is provided through the <tt>manpages-LANG</tt> packages
    (where LANG is the ISO country code).  To access an NLS manual page,
    the user must set the shell LC_MESSAGES variable to the appropriate
    string. E.g. in the case of the German-language manual pages, LC_MESSAGES
    must be set to 'de_DE'.  The <tt>man</tt> program will then search for
    German manual pages under <tt>/usr/share/man/de_DE/</tt>.
</list>

<sect id="usexports">What about the US export regulation limitations?

<p>US laws place restrictions on the export of defense articles, which
includes some types of cryptographic software. PGP and ssh, among others,
fall into this category.

<p>To prevent anyone from taking unnecessary legal risks, certain Debian
GNU/Linux packages are only available from a non-US site
<url id="ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/">, there is a list of
mirror sites <url id="ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/README.mirrors">,
all of which are outside of the US, too.
