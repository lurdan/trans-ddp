<chapt id="getting">Getting and Installing &debian;

<sect id="version">What is the latest version of Debian?

<!-- XXX update for new distros -->
<p>Currently there are two versions of &debian;:
<taglist>
  <tag><em/release &release;, a.k.a. the `stable' distribution/
    <item>This is stable and well tested software, it changes if major
    security or usability fixes are incorporated.
  <tag><em/the `unstable' distribution/
    <item>This is the version currently under development; it is updated
    continuously.  You can retrieve packages from the `unstable' archive
    on any Debian FTP site and use them to upgrade your system at any
    time, but you may not expect the system to be as usable or as stable
    as before - that's why it's called `<strong/unstable/'!
</taglist>

<p>Please see <ref id="dists"> for more information.

<sect id="boot-floppies">Where/how can I get the Debian installation disks?

<p>You can get the installation disks by downloading the appropriate files
from the Debian FTP site: <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/">
and its <url name="mirrors" id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">.

<sect id="cdrom">How do I install the Debian from CD-ROMs?

<p>Linux supports the ISO 9660 (CD-ROM) file system with Rock Ridge
extensions (formerly known as "High Sierra").  Several <url name="vendors"
id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors"> provide &debian; in this format.

<p>Warning: When installing from CD-ROM, it is usually not a good idea
to choose dselect's <tt>cdrom</tt> access method. This method is usually
very slow.
The <tt/mountable/ and <tt/apt/ methods, for example, are much better for
installing from CD-ROM (see <ref id="dpkg-mountable"> and <ref id="apt">).

<sect id="cdimages">I have my own CD-writer, are there CD images available
  somewhere?

<p>Yes. To make it easier for CD vendors to provide high quality
disks, we provide the <url id="http://cdimage.debian.org/" name="Official
CD images">.

<sect id="floppy">Can I install it from a pile of floppy disks?

<p>First of all, a warning: whole &debian; is way too large to be installed
from media as small as a standard 1.44MB floppy disk - you may not find
installing from floppies a very pleasant experience.

<p>Copy the Debian packages onto formatted floppy disks.  Either a DOS,
the native Linux "ext2", or the "minix" format will do; one just has to
use a mount command appropriate to the floppy being used.

<p>Using floppy disks has these complications:
<list>
  <item>Short MS-DOS filenames: If you are trying to place Debian package
     files onto MS-DOS formatted disks, you will find that their names
     are generally too long, and do not conform to the MS-DOS 8.3 filename
     limitation.  To overcome this, Debian developers make all of their
     packages available by 8.3 filenames in separate "msdos" subdirectories
     (<tt>stable/msdos-i386/</tt>, <tt>contrib/msdos-i386/</tt> and
     <tt>non-free/msdos-i386/</tt>). The files in these subdirectories are
     merely symbolic links to the Debian archive files; the files do not
     differ from the files in the <tt>binary-i386/</tt>, etc. directories.
   <item>Large file sizes:  Some packages are larger than 1.44 MBytes, and
     will not fit onto a single floppy disk.  To solve this problem, use the
     dpkg-split tool (see <ref id="dpkg-split">), available in the
     <tt>tools</tt> directory at <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/">
     and its <url name="mirrors" id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">.
</list>

<p>You must have support in the kernel for floppy disks in order to read and
write to floppy disk; most kernels come with floppy drive support included
in them.

<p>To mount a floppy disk under the mount point <tt>/floppy</tt>
(a directory which should have been created during installation), use:
<list>
  <item><example>mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /floppy/</example>
   if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an MS-DOS filesystem,
  <item><example>mount -t msdos /dev/fd1 /floppy/</example>
   if the floppy disk is in drive B: and has an MS-DOS filesystem,
  <item><example>mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy/</example>
   if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an ext2 (i.e., a normal
   Linux) filesystem.
</list>

<sect id="remoteinstall">Can I get and install Debian directly from a
  remote Internet site?

<p>Yes.  There are several methods for doing this:

<list>
  <item><strong/Using APT:/
    install the <package/apt/ package, and edit the
    <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file to suit your needs. You should
    change it to include information about a Debian mirror closest to you.
    Details on this can be found in <manref name="apt-get" section="8">
    and <manref name="sources.list" section="8"> manual pages, as well as in
    the APT User's Guide, in <tt>/usr/share/doc/apt/guide.html/index.html</tt>.

    <p>Then run
      <example>apt-get update</example>
    followed by
      <example>apt-get upgrade</example>
    and your system will be upgraded to the latest Debian release.

  <item><strong/Using dselect and dpkg-ftp:/
    install the <package/dpkg-ftp/ package (see <ref id="dpkg-ftp">).

    <p>Then invoke the program <prgn/dselect/, which will call <prgn/dpkg-ftp/
    for you, guide you through the selection of packages, then install the
    packages, without every downloading the packages themselves to your
    machine. This method is designed to save the user both disk space and
    time.

    <p>Dselect will ask you for the fully qualified domain name of the
    anonymous ftp site you plan to use (if you don't know of any, try
    ftp.debian.org or http.us.debian.org).

    <p>It'll also ask you for the directory which contains the files you
    want to install, or the subdirectories which contain files you want to
    install.  This directory must contain a file called "Packages" (or its
    compressed equivalent, "Packages.gz"), usually
    dists/stable/main/binary-ARCH, where ARCH stands for your machine
    architecture.
</list>

<p>Please note that when you get and install the packages, you'll still have
them kept in your /var directory hierarchy, so remember to delete extra
files, or to move them someplace else (hint: use <package/apt-move/), or
your partition may overflow.

<sect id="tape">Can I get and install Debian from a tape device?

<!-- obsolete? -->

<p>At present, installing packages directly from tape is not supported.
One can however, use <tt>tar</tt>, <tt>cpio</tt>, or <tt>afio</tt> to
copy Debian archive files onto a tape, then copy them onto your local
disk for installation.  In the same vein, floppy disks containing "tar"
files would have to be copied onto a local disk before they could be
managed with the Debian package tools.
