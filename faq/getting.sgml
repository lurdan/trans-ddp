<chapt id="getdeb">Getting and Installing &debian;

<sect id="version">What is the latest version of Debian?

<P>Currently there are two versions of &debian;:
<list>
  <!-- XXX this needs to be changed for potato! -->
  <item>"2.1", a.k.a. "stable". This is stable software, but it may change
  when major fixes are incorporated.
  <item>the "unstable" version, future "2.2".  This is the version currently
  under development; it is updated continuously.  You can retrieve packages
  from the "unstable" archive on any Debian FTP site and use them to upgrade
  your system at any time, but you may not expect the system to be as usable
  or as stable as before - that's why it's called "unstable"!
  <p>It is planned that this will become a new Debian release several months
  after the last release.
</list>

<sect id="boot-floppies">Where/how can I get the Debian installation disks?

<P>You can get the installation disks by downloading the appropriate files
from the Debian FTP site: <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/">
and its <url name="mirrors" id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">.

<sect id="cdrom">How do I get and install the Debian from CD-ROM?

<P>Linux supports the ISO 9660 (CD-ROM) file system with Rock Ridge
extensions (formerly known as "High Sierra").  Several <url name="vendors"
id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors"> provide &debian; in this format.

<P>Warning: When installing from CD-ROM, it is usually not a good idea
to choose dselect's <tt>cdrom</tt> access method. This method is usually
very slow.
The <tt>mountable</tt> and <tt>apt</tt> methods, for example, are much
better for installing from CD-ROM.

<sect id="cdimages">I have my own CD-writer, are there CD images available
  somewhere?

<P>Yes. To make it easier for CD vendors to provide high quality
disks we provide the <url id="http://cdimage.debian.org/" name="Official
CD images">.

<sect id="floppy">How can I get/install the Debian from a set of floppy disks?

<P>Copy the Debian packages onto formatted floppy disks.  Either a DOS,
the native Linux "ext2", or the "minix" format will do; one just has to
use a mount command appropriate to the floppy being used.

<P>Using floppy disks has these complications:
<list>
  <item>Short MS-DOS filenames: If you are trying to place Debian package
     files onto MS-DOS formatted disks, you will find that their names
     are generally too long, and do not conform to the MS-DOS 8.3 filename
     limitation.  To overcome this, Debian developers make all of their
     packages available by 8.3 filenames in separate "msdos" subdirectories
     (<tt>stable/msdos-i386/</tt>, <tt>contrib/msdos-i386/</tt> and
     <tt>non-free/msdos-i386/</tt>). The files in these subdirectories are
     merely symbolic links to the Debian archive files; the files do not
     differ from the files in the <tt>binary-i386/</tt>, etc. directories.
   <item>Large file sizes:  Some packages are larger than 1.44 MBytes, and
     will not fit onto a single floppy disk.  To solve this problem, use the
     dpkg-split tool (see <ref id="dpkg-split">), available in the
     <tt>tools</tt> directory at <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/">
     and its <url name="mirrors" id="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">.
</list>

<P>You must have support in the kernel for floppy disks in order to read and
write to floppy disk; most kernels come with floppy drive support included
in them.

<P>To mount a floppy disk under the mount point <tt>/floppy</tt>
(a directory which should have been created during installation), use:
<list>
  <item><tt>mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /floppy/</tt>
   if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an MS-DOS filesystem,
  <item><tt>mount -t msdos /dev/fd1 /floppy/</tt>
   if the floppy disk is in drive B: and has an MS-DOS filesystem,
  <item><tt>mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy/</tt>
   if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an ext2 (i.e., a normal Linux)
   filesystem.
</list>

<sect id="anonftp">How can I get and install Debian directly from a remote
  (anonymous) FTP site?

<!-- this must all be replaced by instructions for using APT -->

<P>Install the Debian package <package/dpkg-ftp/ (see <ref id="howtocurrent">).

For details on installing a package, see <ref id="dpkg">.

<P>Then invoke the program <tt>dselect</tt>, which will call <tt>dpkg-ftp</tt>
for you, guide you through the selection of packages, then install the
packages, without every downloading the packages themselves to your machine.
This method is designed to save the user both disk space and time.
Note that no special kernel configuration is needed to access and
install Debian packages by this method.

<P>To use this service of <tt>dselect</tt>, you will need to know:
<list>
  <item>the fully qualified domain name of the anonymous ftp site you
  plan to use.
  <item>the directory which contains the files you want to install, or the
  subdirectories which contain files you want to install.  This directory
  must contain a file called "Packages" (or its compressed equivalent,
  "Packages.gz").
</list>
<!-- XXX potential /var overflow -->

<sect id="atape">How can I get and install Debian from a tape?

<!-- obsolete? -->

<P>At present, installing packages directly from tape is not supported.
One can however, use <tt>tar</tt>, <tt>cpio</tt>, or <tt>afio</tt> to
copy Debian archive files onto a tape, then copy them onto your local
disk for installation.  In the same vein, floppy disks containing "tar"
files would have to be copied onto a local disk before they could be
managed with the Debian package tools.
