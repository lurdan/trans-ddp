      <p>
Please note that newer versions of this file can always be found at
<url id="&url-dselect-beginner;">.

      <p>
This file documents <prgn>dselect</prgn> for first-time users, and is
intended to help in getting Debian installed successfully. It makes no
attempt to explain everything, so when you first encounter
<prgn>dselect</prgn>, read through the help screens.
      <p>
If you are eager to get Debian running as soon as possible, well, you
shouldn't use <prgn>dselect</prgn> :-) Debian installation procedure
allows you to run <prgn>tasksel</prgn> which provides some generalized
tasks that you can select and be done with it.
      <p>
<prgn>dselect</prgn> is used to select which packages you wish to
install (there are currently around &num-of-distrib-pkgs; packages in
Debian &release;).  It will be run for you during the install and as
it is a very powerful and somewhat complex thing which can be used for
good or for evil; some knowledge of it beforehand is highly
recommended. Careless use of <prgn>dselect</prgn> can severely mess up
your system.
      <p>
<prgn>dselect</prgn> will guide you through the package installation
process as follows:

<list>
	  <item>Choose the access method to use.
	  <item>Update list of available packages, if possible.
	  <item>Request which packages you want on your system.
	  <item>Install and upgrade wanted packages.
	  <item>Configure any packages that are unconfigured.
	  <item>Remove unwanted software.
</list>

As each step is completed successfully it will lead you on to the next.
Go through them in order without skipping any steps.

      <p>
Here and there in this document we talk of starting another
shell. Linux has 6 console sessions or shells available at any one
time. You switch betwen them by hitting <em>Left Alt-F1</em> through
<em>Left Alt-F6</em>, after which you log in on your new shell and
go ahead.  The console used by the install process is the first one,
a.k.a., tty1, so hit <em>Left Alt-F1</em> when you want to return to
that process.

    <chapt id="main">Once <prgn>dselect</prgn> is Launched
      <p>
Once in <prgn>dselect</prgn> you will get this screen:

<example>
Debian `dselect' package handling frontend.

   0. [A]ccess    Choose the access method to use. 
   1. [U]pdate    Update list of available packages, if possible. 
   2. [S]elect    Request which packages you want on your system.
   3. [I]nstall   Install and upgrade wanted packages. 
   4. [C]onfig    Configure any packages that are unconfigured. 
   5. [R]emove    Remove unwanted software.
   6. [Q]uit      Quit dselect.

[some other stuff]
</example>

Let's look at these one by one.

      <sect id="access">``Access''
	<p>
Here's the access screen:

<example>
dselect - list of access methods
  Abbrev.        Description
  cdrom          Install from a CD-ROM.
* multi_cd       Install from a CD-ROM set.
  nfs            Install from an NFS server (not yet mounted).
  multi_nfs      Install from an NFS server (using the CD-ROM set) (not yet mounted).
  harddisk       Install from a hard disk partition (not yet mounted).
  mounted        Install from a filesystem which is already mounted.
  multi_mount    Install from a mounted partition with changing contents.
  floppy         Install from a pile of floppy disks.
  apt            APT Acquisition [file,http,ftp]
</example>

	<p>
Here we tell <prgn>dselect</prgn> where our packages are.  Please
ignore the order that these appear in.  It is very important that you
select the proper method for installation.  
You may have a few more methods listed, or a few less, or see them
listed in a different order; just don't worry about it.
In the following list, we describe the different methods.

<taglist>
	    <tag>apt</tag>
	    <item>
One of the best options for installation from a local mirror of the
Debian archive, or from the network.  This method uses the ``apt''
(see <manref name="apt" section="8">)
system to do complete dependency analysis and ordering, so it's most
likely to install packages in the optimal order.
	      <p>
Configuration of this method is straight-forward; you may select any
number of different locations, mixing and matching <tt>file:</tt> URLs
(local disks or NFS mounted disks), <tt>http:</tt> URLs, or
<tt>ftp:</tt> URLs. You can also include CD-ROM/DVD media with <prgn/apt-cdrom/.
	      <p>
Please see the <manref name="sources.list" section="5"> manual page for more
information on the format of the <file>/etc/apt/sources.list</file> file.
	      <p>
If you have proxy server for either HTTP or FTP (or both), make sure
you set the <tt>http_proxy</tt> or <tt>ftp_proxy</tt> environment
variables, respectively.  Set them from your shell before starting
dselect, e.g.:
<example>
# export http_proxy=http://gateway:3128/
# dselect
</example>

	    <tag>multi_cd</tag>
	    <item>
Quite large and powerful, this complex method is the recommended way
of installing a recent version of Debian from a set of multiple binary
CDs. Each of these CDs should contain information about the packages
in itself and all prior CDs (in the file <file>Packages.cd</file>).
When you first select this method, be sure the CD-ROM you will be
using is not mounted. Place the last <em>binary</em> disk of the set
(we don't need the source CDs) in the drive and answer the questions
you are asked:
<list>
		  <item>
	CD-ROM drive location
		  <item>
	Confirmation that you are using a multi-cd set
		  <item>
	The location of the Debian distribution on the disk(s)
		  <item>
	[ Possibly ] the location(s) of the Packages file(s)
</list>
	      <p>
Once you have updated the available list and selected the packages to
be installed, the multi-cd method diverges from normal procedure. You
will need to run an ``install'' step for each of the CDs you have in
turn. Unfortunately due to the limitations of dselect it will not be
able to prompt you for a new disk at each stage; the way to work for
each disk is
<list>
		  <item>
	Insert the CD in your CD-ROM drive.
		  <item>
	From the main dselect menu, select ``Install''.
		  <item>
	Wait until dpkg finishes installing from this CD (it may
	report installation successful, or possibly installation
	errors. Don't worry about these until later).
		  <item>
	Hit [<em>Enter</em>] to go back to the main dselect menu. 
		  <item>
	Repeat with the next CD in the set...
</list>
	      <p>
It may be neccesary to run the installation step more than once to
cover the order of package installation - some packages installed
early may need to have later packages installed before they will
configure properly.
	      <p>
Running a ``Configure'' step is recommended, to help fix any packages
that may end up in this state.

	    <tag>multi_nfs, multi_mount</tag>
	    <item>
These are very similar to the multi_cd method above, and are
refinements on the theme of coping with changing media, for example if
installing off a multi-cd set exported via NFS from another machine's
CD-ROM drive.

	    <tag>floppy</tag>
	    <item>
Caters for those people without CD-ROM or network access. Not
recommended as a viable installation option anymore if you are using
traditionally-sized floppies, but may work better for LS/120 or Zip
drives. Specify the location of your floppy drive, then feed
floppies. The first one should contain the Packages file. This method
is slow and may be unreliable due to media problems.

<![ IGNORE [ <tag>ftp</tag>
	    <item>
<strong>DEPRECATED METHOD -- use apt instead.  Only try this method if
all else fails!</strong>
	      <p>
You will be asked to supply the address of an FTP site, whether you
want to use passive mode (for proxied FTP), a username/password
combination, the path to the Debian directory, the list of
distributions you are interested in and a place to download the binary
package files to (relative to /var/lib/dpkg/methods/ftp).
	      <p>
The setup script will then immediately attempt to connect to the
remote server to grab the Packages file(s) etc., then dselect will
reconnect later when you actually start installing packages.
	      <p>
If you need to work through a firewall this method should work well,
and is ideal for people without much local disk space.]]>

<![ IGNORE [ <tag>http</tag>
	    <item>
<strong>DEPRECATED METHOD -- use apt instead.  Only try this method if
all else fails!</strong>
	      <p>
Similar to `ftp', but will use a mixture of <tt>http:</tt>,
<tt>ftp:</tt> and <tt>file:</tt> URIs to find the Debian files. You
can set it up to use different proxies for <tt>http:</tt> and
<tt>ftp:</tt> URIs if necessary. Very useful if a local proxy will
cache the package files for multiple users, or if a mirror only allows
HTTP access and not FTP.  ]]>

	    <tag>nfs</tag>
	    <item>
<strong>DEPRECATED METHOD -- use apt or multi_nfs instead.  Only try
this method if all else fails.</strong>
	      <p>
This is a simple installation method, with simple requirements: give
it the address of the NFS server, the location of the Debian
distribution on the server and (maybe) the Packages file(s). Then
<prgn>dselect</prgn> will install the various sections in turn from the
server. Slow but easy; does not use proper ordering, so it will take
many runs of the ``Install'' and/or ``Configure'' steps.  Obviously
only appropriate for NFS based installation.

	    <tag>harddisk</tag>
	    <item>
<strong>DEPRECATED METHOD -- use apt or multi_mount instead.  Only try
this method if all else fails!</strong>
	      <p>
Supply the block device of the hard drive partition to use, and the
locations of the Debian files on that partition, as usual. Slow and
easy.  Does not use proper ordering, so it will take many runs of the
``Install'' and/or ``Configure'' steps.  Not recommended, since the
``apt'' method supports this functionality, with proper ordering.

	    <tag>mounted</tag>
	    <item>
<strong>DEPRECATED METHOD -- use apt or multi_mount instead.  Only try
this method if all else fails!</strong>
	      <p>
Simply specify the location(s) of the Debian files in your
filesystem. Possibly the easiest method, but slow. Does not use proper
ordering, so it will take many runs of the ``Install'' and/or
``Configure'' steps.

<![ IGNORE [ <tag>mountable</tag>
	    <item>
<strong>DEPRECATED METHOD -- use apt or multi_mount instead.  Only try
this method if all else fails!</strong>
	      <p>
A more complex method than ``mounted'', and a good deal faster -- it
will scan only the packages needed. It gives more control over the
installation options than some of the other methods, but requires more
setup.  ]]>


	    <tag>cdrom</tag>
	    <item>
<strong>DEPRECATED METHOD -- use multi_cd instead.  This method simply
does not work with multiple CD sets, such as are included in Debian
&release;.</strong>
	      <p>
Designed for single-CD installations, this simple method will ask for
the location of your CD-ROM drive, the location of the Debian
distribution on that disk and then (if necessary) the location(s) of
the Packages file(s) on the disk. Simple but quite slow.  Does not use
proper ordering, so it will take many runs of the ``Install'' and/or
``Configure'' steps.  Not recommended, because it assumes the
distribution is on a single CD-ROM, which is no longer the case.  Use
the ``multi_cd'' method instead.

	  </taglist>

	<p>
If you run into any problems -- maybe Linux can not see your CD-ROM,
your NFS mount is not working or you have forgotten which partition
the packages are on -- you have a couple of options:

<list>
	    <item>
Start another shell. Fix the problem and then return to the main shell.
	    <item>
Quit <prgn>dselect</prgn> and run it again later. You might even need
to shut down the computer to solve some problem. This is quite ok but
when you come back to <prgn>dselect</prgn> run it as root. It will not
be run automatically after the first time.
</list>

	<p>
After you choose the access method <prgn>dselect</prgn> will get you
to indicate the precise location of the packages. If you do not get
this right the first time hit <em>Control-C</em> and return to the
``Access'' item.

	<p>
Once you are finished here, you will be returned to the main screen.

      <sect id="update">``Update''
	<p>
<prgn>dselect</prgn> will read the <file>Packages</file> or
<file>Packages.gz</file> files from the mirror and create a database
on your system of all available packages.  This may take a while as it
downloads and processes the files.

      <sect id="select">``Select''
	<p>
Hang on to your hat. This is where it all happens. The purpose of this
step is to select just which packages you wish to have installed.
	<p>
Hit <em>Enter</em>. If you have a slow machine be aware that the screen will
clear and can remain blank for some 15 seconds, so don't start bashing
keys at this point, just be patient.
	<p>
The first thing that comes up on the screen is page 1 of the Help
file.  You can get to this help by hitting <em>?</em> at any time in
the ``Select'' screens and you can page through the help screens by
hitting the <em>.</em> (full stop) key.

	<p>
Please be prepared to take an hour or so as you have to learn your way
around and then get it right. When you enter the ``Select'' screen for
the first time, don't make <strong>ANY</strong> selections at all -- just
hit <em>Enter</em> and see what dependency problems there are. Try fixing
them. If you find yourself back at the main screen, enter <ref id="select">
again.

	<p>
Before you dive in, note these points:

<list>
	    <item>
To exit the ``Select'' screen after all selections are complete, hit
<em>Enter</em>. This will return you to the main screen if there is no
problem with your selection.  Otherwise, you will be asked to deal
with that problem. When you are happy with any given screen, hit
<em>Enter</em> to get out.
	    <item>
Problems are quite normal and are to be expected. If you select
package <var>A</var> and that package requires package <var>B</var> to
run, then <prgn>dselect</prgn> will warn you of the problem and will
most likely suggest a solution. If package <var>A</var> conflicts with
package <var>B</var> (i.e., if they are mutually exclusive) you will
be asked to decide between them.
</list>

<p>Let's look at the top two lines of the ``Select'' screen.

<example>
dselect - main package listing (avail., priority)    mark:+/=/- verbose:v help:?
EIOM Pri Section  Package      Inst.ver    Avail.ver   Description
</example>

	<p>
This header reminds us of some of the special keys:

<taglist>
	    <tag><tt>+</tt>
	    <item>
Select a package for installation.

	    <tag><tt>=</tt>
	    <item>
Place a package on hold -- useful on a broken package. You can
reinstall an older version and place it on hold while you wait for a
new one to appear. (These things rarely happen with stable Debian, though.)

	    <tag><tt>-</tt>
Remove a package.

	    <tag><tt>_</tt>
	    <item>
Purge a package: remove both the package and its configuration files.

	    <tag><tt>i,I</tt>
	    <item>
Toggle/cycle display of additional information (in the bottom part of the
screen).

	    <tag><tt>o,O</tt>
	    <item>
Cycle through the sort options (in the top part of the screen).

	    <tag><tt>v,V</tt>
	    <item>
A terse/verbose toggle. When you press this, you will find out what do the
letters EIOM on the second line mean. But here's a summary:
<example>
Flag   Meaning           Possible values 
E      Error             Space, R, I
I      Installed state   Space, *, -, U, C, I 
O      Old mark          *, -, =, _, n
M      Mark              *, -, =, _, n 
</example>
(Note that upper and lower case keys are quite different in effect.)
	  </taglist>

	<p>
Rather that spell all this out here, I will refer you to the Help screens
where everything will be revealed to you. One example, though:
	<p>
You enter <prgn>dselect</prgn> and find a line like this:

<example>
EIOM Pri  Section  Package   Description 
  ** Opt  misc     loadlin   a loader (running under DOS) for LINUX kernel
</example>

This means that loadlin was selected when you last ran
<prgn>dselect</prgn> and that it is still selected, but it is not
installed. Why not? The answer must be that the loadlin package is not
physically available, that is, it must be missing from your mirror.
	<p>
The information which <prgn>dselect</prgn> uses to get all the right
packages installed is buried in the Packages files (the thing you downloaded
in the [U]pdate step). These files are generated from the packages
themselves.
	<p>
Nothing in this world is perfect and it sometimes happens that the
dependencies built into a package are incorrect, which can cause a situation
that <prgn>dselect</prgn> simply cannot resolve. However, you can get out
of such a loop by using the commands <em>Q</em> and <em>X</em>.

<taglist>
	    <tag><em>Q</em>
	    <item>
An override. Forces <prgn>dselect</prgn> to ignore the built-in
dependencies and to do what you have specified. This could, of course,
turn out to be a bad idea.

	    <tag><em>X</em>
	    <item>
Use <em>X</em> if you get totally lost. It puts things back the way
they were and exits.
</taglist>

	      <p>
Keys which help you <em>not</em> to get lost (!) are <em>R</em>,
<em>U</em> and <em>D</em>.

<taglist>
	    <tag><em>R</em>
	    <item>
Cancels all selections at this level. Does not affect selections made
at the previous level.

	    <tag><em>U</em>
	    <item>
If <prgn>dselect</prgn> had proposed changes and then you made additional
changes, <em>U</em> will restore <prgn>dselect</prgn>'s selections.

	    <tag><em>D</em>
	    <item>
Removes the selections made by <prgn>dselect</prgn>, leaving only
yours.
</taglist>

	<p>
An example follows.  The <package>xmms</package> package (chosen because
it has a lot of dependencies) depends on these packages:

<list>
	<item><package>libc6</package>
	<item><package>libglib1.2</package>
	<item><package>libgtk1.2</package>
	<item><package>xlibs</package>
</list>

	<p>
The following packages should also be installed. These are not,
however, essential:

<list>
	<item><package>libaudiofile0</package>
	<item><package>libesd0</package>
	<item><package>libgl1</package>
	<item><package>libmikmod2</package>
	<item><package>libogg0</package>
	<item><package>libvorbis0</package>
	<item><package>libxml1</package>
	<item><package>zlib1g</package>
</list>

<!-- We'll ignore the Suggests: line for the sake of brevity. -->

	<p>
So, when I select <package>xmms</package>, I get a screen like this:

<example>
dselect - recursive package listing                  mark:+/=/- verbose:v help:?
EIOM Pri Section  Package      Description
  _* Opt sound    xmms         Versatile X audio player that looks like Winamp
  _* Opt libs     libglib1.2   The GLib library of C routines
  _* Opt libs     libgtk1.2    The GIMP Toolkit set of widgets for X
  _* Opt libs     libmikmod2   A portable sound library
  _* Opt libs     libogg0      Ogg Bitstream Library
  _* Opt libs     libvorbis0   The OGG Vorbis lossy audio compression codec.
</example>

(Other packages may or may not appear, depending on what is already in
your system).  You'll notice that all the required packages have been
selected for me, along with the recommended ones.

	<p>
The <em>R</em> key puts things back to the starting point.

<example>
dselect - recursive package listing                  mark:+/=/- verbose:v help:?
EIOM Pri Section  Package      Description
  __ Opt sound    xmms         Versatile X audio player that looks like Winamp
  __ Opt libs     libglib1.2   The GLib library of C routines
  __ Opt libs     libgtk1.2    The GIMP Toolkit set of widgets for X
  __ Opt libs     libmikmod2   A portable sound library
  __ Opt libs     libogg0      Ogg Bitstream Library
  __ Opt libs     libvorbis0   The OGG Vorbis lossy audio compression codec.
</example>

To decide now that you don't want <package>xmms</package>, just hit
<em>Enter</em>.

	<p>
The <em>D</em>key puts things the way I selected them in the first place:

<example>
dselect - recursive package listing                  mark:+/=/- verbose:v help:?
EIOM Pri Section  Package      Description
  _* Opt sound    xmms         Versatile X audio player that looks like Winamp
  __ Opt libs     libglib1.2   The GLib library of C routines
  __ Opt libs     libgtk1.2    The GIMP Toolkit set of widgets for X
  __ Opt libs     libmikmod2   A portable sound library
  __ Opt libs     libogg0      Ogg Bitstream Library
  __ Opt libs     libvorbis0   The OGG Vorbis lossy audio compression codec.
</example>

	<p>
The <em>U</em> key restores <prgn>dselect</prgn>'s selections:

<example>
dselect - recursive package listing                  mark:+/=/- verbose:v help:?
EIOM Pri Section  Package      Description
  _* Opt sound    xmms         Versatile X audio player that looks like Winamp
  _* Opt libs     libglib1.2   The GLib library of C routines
  _* Opt libs     libgtk1.2    The GIMP Toolkit set of widgets for X
  _* Opt libs     libmikmod2   A portable sound library
  _* Opt libs     libogg0      Ogg Bitstream Library
  _* Opt libs     libvorbis0   The OGG Vorbis lossy audio compression codec.
</example>


	<p>
I suggest running with the defaults for now -- you will have ample
opportunity of adding more later.
	<p>
Whatever you decide, hit <em>Enter</em> to accept and return to the
main screen. If this results in unresolved problems you will be
bounced right back to another problem resolution screen.
	<p>
The <em>R</em>, <em>U</em>, and <em>D</em> keys are very useful in
``what if'' situations. You can experiment at will and then restore
everything and start again. <em>Don't</em> look on them as being in a
glass box labelled ``Break In Emergency.''
	<p>
After making your selections in the ``Select'' screen, hit the
<em>I</em> to give you a big window, <em>t</em> to take you to the
beginning and then use the <em>Page-Down</em> key to look quickly
through the settings. This way you can check the results of your work
and spot glaring errors. Some people have deselected whole groups of
packages by mistake and didn't notice the error until it was too
late. <prgn>dselect</prgn> is a <em>very</em> powerful tool, so you
better not misuse it.

	<p>
You should now have this situation:

<example>
package category     status

required             all selected
important            all selected
standard             mostly selected
optional             mostly deselected
extra                mostly deselected
</example>

	<p>
Happy? Hit <em>Enter</em> to exit the ``Select'' process. You can come back
and run ``Select'' again if you wish.

      <sect id="install">``Install''
	<p>
<prgn>dselect</prgn> runs through the entire set of
&num-of-distrib-pkgs; packages and installs those selected.  Expect to
get asked to make decisions as you go.
	<p>
The screen scrolls past fairly quickly on a fast machine. You can
stop/start it with <em>Control-s</em>/<em>Control-q</em> and at the
end of the run you will get a list of any uninstalled packages. If you
want to keep a record of everything that happens, use common Unix
programs for capturing output, like <manref name="tee" section="1"> or

It can happen that a package does not get installed because it depends
on some other package which is listed for installation but is not yet
installed.  The answer to this is to run ``Install'' again.  It has
been reported that sometimes it was necessary to run it 4 times before
everything fit into place.  This will vary by your acquisistion method;
with the APT method, you will almost never need to run ``Install'' again.

      <sect id="configure">``Configure''
	<p>
Most packages get configured in step 3, but anything left hanging can
be configured here.

      <sect id="remove">``Remove''
	<p>
Removes packages that are installed but no longer required.

      <sect id="quit">``Quit''
	<p>
Exits <prgn>dselect</prgn>.
	<p>
I suggest running <file>/etc/cron.daily/find</file> at this point,
as you have a lot of new files on your system. After this you'll be
able to use <prgn>locate</prgn> to find any given file.



    <chapt id="conclusion">A Few Hints in Conclusion
      <p>
You can get an idea of the size of a package by hitting
<em>i</em> twice and looking for the ``Size'' figure. This is the size
of the compressed package, so the uncompressed files will be a lot bigger
(see ``Installed-Size'', which is in kilo-bytes, to know it).
      <p>
Installing a new Debian system is a fairly complex mission, but
<prgn>dselect</prgn> can help you do it, if you are prepared to take
the time to learn how to `drive' it. Read the help screens and
experiment with <em>i, I, o,</em> and <em>O</em>. Use the <em>R</em>
key. It's all there, but it's up to you to use it effectively.

    <chapt id="glossary">Glossary
      <p>
The following terms are useful to you in this document and in general,
when talking about Debian.

<taglist>

    <tag>Package
	<item>
A file which contains everything needed to install and run a particular
program.
	<p>
Debian package names have the <var>.deb</var> suffix. Each package has a
name and a version. The version consists of the real version (`upstream')
and the Debian revision, separated with a hyphen (`-').
	<p>
Here are some example package names:
	<list>
	  <item><file>efax_08a-1.deb</file>
	  <item><file>lrzsz_0.12b-1.deb</file>
	  <item><file>mgetty_0.99.2-6.deb</file>
	  <item><file>minicom_1.75-1.deb</file>
	  <item><file>term_2.3.5-5.deb</file>
	  <item><file>uucp_1.06.1-2.deb</file>
	  <item><file>uutraf_1.1-1.deb</file>
	  <item><file>xringd_1.10-2.deb</file>
	  <item><file>xtel_3.1-2.deb</file>
	</list>

    <tag>dpkg
	<item>
The program which handles packages is <prgn>dpkg</prgn>.
<prgn>dselect</prgn> is a front end to <prgn>dpkg</prgn>.
Experienced users often use <prgn>dpkg</prgn> to install or remove
a package because it's quicker.

    <tag>package scripts, maintainer scripts
	<item>
The programs (usually shell scripts) that dpkg runs before and after
installing each package. They are usually quiet, but some of them can
display warnings or ask you questions.
