<p>
<![%f-ref;[
This <url id="&debian-reference-project;" name="&full-title;">
is intended to provide a broad overview of the &debian; system as a
<strong>post-installation user's guide</strong>.  Its target reader is
someone who is willing to read shell scripts.  I expect the reader to
have gained basic skills in Unix-like systems prior to reading this
document.
<p> 
I made a conscious decision <strong>not</strong> to explain everything
in detail if it can be found in a <strong>manual page</strong>, an
<strong>info page</strong>, or a <strong>HOWTO document</strong>. 
Instead of full explanations, I have tried to give more directly practical
information by providing <strong>exact command sequences</strong> 
in the main text or <strong>example scripts</strong> under 
<url id="&examples;"> as a reference.  You must understand the content
of examples before issuing commands.  Your system may require slightly 
different command sequences.
<p>
Much of the information included consists of reminders or
pointers to the authoritative references listed in <ref
id="references">.  This is partly because this document originated as a
"<strong>quick reference</strong>".

<strong>Keep it short and simple</strong> (KISS) is my guiding principle.

If the system is installed with the bare minimum of packages, make sure
to execute the following commands to install some essential packages
and a few key documents: 
<example>
# apt-get install info man-db doc-base dhelp apt apt-utils auto-apt \
                  dpkg less mc ssh nano-tiny elvis-tiny vim sash \
                  kernel-package \

                  libpam-doc glibc-doc samba-doc exim-doc cvsbook \
                  gnupg-doc
# apt-get install debian-reference # for Sarge, do this too :)

<sect>Basics of the Debian distributions
<p>
Debian comes in 3 release "flavors": 
<list>
<item><tt>stable</tt>:   Good to track on a production server. Boring for the 
 workstation (WS). 
 <![%f-ref;[See <ref id="stable">.]]>
<item><tt>testing</tt>:  Good to track on the WS. <![%f-ref;[See <ref id="testing">.]]>
<item><tt>unstable</tt>: Never track this blindly.  <![%f-ref;[See <ref id="unstable">.]]>
</list>
Read at least the key mailing list
<tt>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</tt> for updates on the
status of Debian.
<p>
In March 2002, these three release versions corresponded to codename versions
Potato (production quality), Woody (beta-test, very stable then since
release was imminent), and Sid (alpha-test).  In August 2002, right
after the Woody release, these corresponded to Woody
(production quality), Sarge (beta-test, it would be rough around the
edges for some time), and Sid (always alpha-test).  When packages in
<tt>unstable</tt> have no release-critical (RC) bugs filed against them after
the first week or so, they are automatically promoted to <tt>testing</tt>.  
<![%f-ref;[
See <ref id="ftparchives">.

<p>
There are two approaches that enable you to run the latest versions of 
software on a system.  
<list compact>
<item><ref id="woody"> (mainly for WS purposes)
<item><ref id="port"> (mainly for server purposes)
</list>
<![%f-ref;[
<p>
Tracking the <tt>testing</tt> flavor of &debian; has a side effect of
providing security fixes very slowly.  So be warned.
<p>
If you mix flavors of &debian;, using parts of <tt>testing</tt> or
<tt>unstable</tt> in <tt>stable</tt>, you will be likely to uninentionally pull
in many key packages from <tt>testing</tt> or <tt>unstable</tt> that may be
buggy.  So be warned.
<p>
Running <tt>testing</tt> or <tt>unstable</tt> flavors of &debian;
involves an increased risk of hitting serious bugs.  This risk can be managed
by deploying a multibooting scheme with a more stable flavor of &debian;,
or by deploying the nice trick of using <prgn>chroot</prgn> with the more
stable one as described in <ref id="chroot">.  The latter will enable
running different flavors of &debian; simultaneously on different
consoles.
<p>
After explaining some fundamentals of the Debian distribution in <ref
id="system">, I will present some basic information to help you live happily
with the latest software, taking advantage of the <tt>testing</tt> and
<tt>unstable</tt> distributions of Debian. The impatient should proceed
immediately to <ref id="survival">.  Happy upgrading!
