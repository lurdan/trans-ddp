Known problems and needed additions:

* ext3 root can not be easily remounted.  Note /proc/mounts, 
  /proc/filesystem etc. to figure out problem. 
  Read bug # 135537 for good insight :)
* date is in English. (Ugly)
* significant editorial contribution by David Sewell needs noted.
* swap file can be bigger than 128MB for newer kernels (>2.1.?)
* HD optimization "hdparm" needs entry
   "hdparm -tT /dev/hda" and "hdparm -c1 -d1 -u1 -m16 -A /dev/hda" with good
   warning.
* Some parts of translated documents contain English. (Send me translation)
* USB mouse info.

* In order apt-get to see what packages will be removed, use -u option or:
   $ cat >> /etc/apt/apt.conf
   // Always show packages to be upgraded (-u).
   APT::Get::Show-Upgraded "true";
   ^D

* Install conffile if missing: use "dpkg -i --force-confmiss <packagename>".

* "dslect update" vs. "apt-get update": 
  'dselect update' is a superset of 'apt-get update' (if dselect is
   configured to use the apt method, which is the default these days), not
   the other way round.  "dslect update" is needed to be run if 
   "dselect select", "tasksel", or "dpkg" to function correctly.

* apt-show-versions: Lists available package versions with distribution
  Nice for testing/unstable mix environment

* Java plugin for Mozilla/Galeon
  install 'j2re1.3' from a blackdown mirror.
  To install the plugin (if you really want to do it manually) just copy
  the .so to the plugins directory and restart galeon.
* debsum: Joerg Wendland <joergland@debian.org>
  The temporary fix for sysadmins could be
    DPkg::Post-Install-Pkgs {"xargs /usr/bin/debsums -sg";};
  in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90debsums (untested).
* More on xauth, ssh-agent, ...
* boot failure recovery using "-b" or "emergency" at the boot prompt of 
  the boot floppy ==  drops you in a shell before *anything* else.
* pgp.net keyserver corrupts key in the server with more than 1 subkey
* change max number of process: "ulimit -u 1000", /etc/security/limits.conf
* CUPS
  edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. then "links http://localhost:631".
* procmail to filter duplicates
  $ man procmailex
  / dupl RET
* "less" to read gzipped text files automatically, 
  read /usr/doc/less/LESSOPEN
* make-kpkg on SMP: "man 5 kernel-pkg.conf" CONCURRENCY_LEVEL 
* Book: Kernighan & Pike's "The UNIX Programming Environment"
* typesetting documents in cnsole: "info groff" "man groff_ms"
* install things not in a Debian package in /usr/local.
  $ cd src
  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  $ make
  $ make install # this puts the files in the system
* SAMBA neiboughers
  $ smbclient -N -L ip_adress_of_your_PDC|less
  $ nmblookup -T "*"
* Strange problem accessing some web sites experienced.
  To check ECN:
  # cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
  or
  # sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_ecn
  To turn it off, use:
  # echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
  or
  # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_ecn=0
  To disable TCP ECN on every boot, edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add:
  net.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 0
* print web page
  $ apt-get install html2ps
  $ html2ps <URL> | lpr
* GRUB
  http://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/l-grub/l-grub-3-6.html
* pid of software: "man 8 pidof"
* programing: memory leak tools
  njamd, valgrind, dmalloc, electric-fence, memprof, memwatch, mpatrol, 
  leaktracer, libgc6
  http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/zorn/public_html/MallocDebug.html
  Insure++ (from http://www.parasoft.com non-free)
* Recover after deleting everything under /var
  Createthe /var/cache/apt/archives and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial 
  directories then running "apt-cache gencaches".
* Set default domain to do 'ping host' not 'ping host.mydomain':
  add a 'search' directive to /etc/resolv.conf
* CD-ROM + CD-R/RW, Warren Dodge wrote:
  Add this line to your /etc/modutils/aliases file and run update-modules:
    pre-install      ide-scsi      modprobe ide-cd
  This causes the IDE driver to load before ide-scsi. It then takes control of
  the ATAPID CD-ROM -- anything that it hasn't been told to ignore. That leaves
  just the ignored devices for ide-scsi to control.
* Mount HD image (xxxx = bytes/sector * sectors/cylinder, bytes/sector=512)
  $ mount -o loop,offset=xxxx file.img /mnt
* cleanup of /usr/local
  $ find /usr/local -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
* digital camera = www.gphoto.org 
  Also note that any camera with removable media will work with Linux
  through USB Mass Storage-compatible readers.
* Generate any extra locales 
  $ dpkg-reconfigure locales
* SSH X forwarding dead
  Check /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the machine you're connecting to and make
  sure you have 'X11Forwarding yes' in there.  There's more information in
  /usr/share/doc/ssh/README.Debian.gz.
* DBS package for multi-patch source
* Section 9.5.3 Connect with fewer passwords -RSAAuthentication
  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
  $ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub user1@remote











Action plan:
* Use po-debiandoc by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org> to manage 
  translation.
