* Package a single binary per Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>

  # mkdir -p mypkg/usr/bin mypkg/DEBIAN
  # cp binary mypkg/usr/bin
  # cat > mypkg/DEBIAN/control
  Package: mypackage
  Version: 1
  Architecture: i386
  Maintainer: Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  Description: my little package
  Don't expect much.
  ^D
  # dpkg-deb -b mypkg
  
  Disclaimer: I know the Debian packaging system a little bit better than
  most people. :-) Nevertheless, this kind of quick-n-dirty thing can be
  really handy.

* What exactly has been upgraded?
  check /var/backups/dpkg.status*

* uninstall binary of non-Debian software, use checkinstall.
  # apt-get install checkinstall

* upgrade with apt-get

  (per Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>)
  Perhaps you're updating with 'apt-get update' rather than 'dselect
  update', and then using some tool (like 'dpkg -p' or dselect) that
  expects dpkg's available database to be up-to-date? 
  
* SMTP auth (yahoo.com)
/etc/exim/exim.conf
<example>
remote_smtp:
  driver = smtp
  authenticate_hosts = smtp.mail.yahoo.com
...

smarthost:
  driver = domainlist
  transport = remote_smtp
  route_list = "* smtp.mail.yahoo.com bydns_a"
...

plain:
  driver = plaintext
  public_name = PLAIN
  client_send = "^cmatheson3^this_is_my_password"
</example>
Do not forget double quotes in the last line.

* Chrooted Debian install from base image
 check pbuilder/debootstrap for Woody
 For Potato environment

* One-time login password for account activation
  Use passwd command with -e option. passwd(1)

* Good password policy
  Use PAM and cracklib2 and put in /etc/pam.d/passwd
    password required       pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=6 difok=3

* fbset for all ttys
  # fbset -t 13334 144 24 29 3 136 6 -a

* two-sided and two-in-one printing of PDF
  gv: 
   print even and odd pages
  mpage
    env variable set to "-bA4 -t -T -2 -Pprn0008" for double-sided A4 with 
    two pages to each sheet
  a2ps is alternative to mpage
  
  CUPS (per Derrick 'dman' Hudson <dman@dman.ddts.net>)
    1) print to file
    2) lp -o number-up=2 -o page-set=even
    3) reinsert pages in printer
    4) lp -o number-up=2 -o page-set=odd

* merging two ps/pdf files
 Oki DZ <okidz@pindad.com>
 $ gs -r300x300 -dNOCACHE -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dBATCH
    -sOutputFile=test3.pdf test1.ps test2.ps
    
 You can change the -sDevice to pswrite if you want ps output.

 Eduard Bloch <edi@gmx.de>
 gs  -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=bla.ps -f 1.ps 2.ps

  Listen only to Manoj and Herbert on this subject but even for them it is
  difficult sometimes.

* Pinning unstable
http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2002/1/mail#1

* Synchronising files on laptop with server
rsync  1-way synchronization
unison 2-way synchronization

* version control system
rcs         simple collections of diff
cvs         concurrent, stable
arch        new, no such thing as a "working directory"
subversion  new, Apache

* Serial line tune
  # apt-get install hwtools
  $ cd /usr/share/doc/hwtools/
  $ links irqtune.html # lynx

   irqtune changes the IRQ priority of devices to allow devices that
   require high priority and fast service (e.g. serial ports, modems) to
   have it.

   With irqtune, a 3X speedup of serial/modem throughput is possible.

* Japanese UTF-8/X (per Claudio Bley <bley@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>)
1) add a locale to /etc/locale.gen that supports Japanese characters (e.g.
   ja_JP.UTF-8). (Don't forget to run locale-gen after modifying that file) 
2) install the relevant fonts in order to display Japanese characters.
3) Then, you usually need to set XMODIFIERS to "@im=kinput2" and at least
   LC_CTYPE to a Japanese locale *before* starting the application. 
   You may want to do this when starting the X server. 
   You may also add "*inputMethod: kinput2" to your X resources file 
   - some applications are also using this.
4) Some applications (such as mlterm) also allow you to change/set up that
   information dynamically at run time (press Ctrl-MBtn-3 in mlterm).
5) If you started the application, you should press Shift+Space and a
   window should pop up stating that you now may input Japanese characters.

* less to read *.gz
man less - look for section headed INPUT PREPROCESSOR
/usr/share/doc/less/LESSOPEN
man lesspipe

* Printing man pages
 $ man -Tps some-man-page | lpr
 $ man -Tps some-man-page | mpage -2 | lpr

* mutt to do mail expiry (Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>)
In .muttrc:
# Expire most Debian lists after two weeks.
folder-hook=debian/(devel|policy|perl|boot|user|testing|mentors|qa|qa-packages)$ "push '<delete-pattern> ~d >2w\n'"

* exim address rewrite for "From:" (Derrick 'dman' Hudson <dman@dman.ddts.net>)
/etc/exim/exim.conf contains:
  *@host1.ursine.dyndns.org \
  "${if eq {${lookup{$1}lsearch{/etc/passwd}{1}{0}}} {1}  \
   {$0}{$1@ursine.dyndns.org}}"  frFs

What it does is rewrite all addresses matching "*@host1.ursine.dyndns.org".  
1) It does a linear search through /etc/password to see if the local part ($1)
   is a local user or not.  
2) If it is a local user, it rewrites the address to the same thing it was in
   the first place ($0).
3) If it is not a local user, it rewrites the domain part.

* kernel header files for user application
Some may still say: 
>  The problem under Debian and SuSE is that the Linux kernel is
>  not installed under /usr/src/linux - so you just need to ensure
>  that /usr/src/linux links to the directory containing the Linux
>  kernel sources. ...

Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org> said:
That is absolutely terrible advice. It's a very good way to break a Debian
system, and you should ignore it. Linus doesn't recommend this old way of doing
things nowadays either.

Instead, if you *need* kernel headers for something, alter the Makefiles so
that their include path points to
<wherever-your-kernel-source-is>/include/linux, etc. 

Most "normal" programs don't need kernel headers and in fact may break if you
use them directly; instead they should be compiled against the headers with
which glibc was built, which are the versions in /usr/include/linux and
/usr/include/asm.

* GIF and UNISYS issue
GIMP issues are already answered but let me draw your attention to the
UNISYS issue.

   http://www.ora.com/infocenters/gff/gff-faq/

I never used it but there are utilities called ungif in Debian.  That
may be what you want :)

   $ apt-cache search ungif

With this, you can use GIF like the Debian website :-)
(We all know the GNU site does not like using these non-LZW GIFs
either.)

* Package split scenario (Check NM/Dev REF)
The groff split example:
  Potato:
    groff
  Woody:
    groff-base Suggests: groff, groff-x11
    groff Depends: groff-base, Suggests: groff-x11
    groff-x11 Depends: groff-base, Suggests: groff

* memwatch (memory test)
It is listed on the GNU site.

=== TIPS not good enough to be included yet ===
* apt-show-versions: Lists available package versions with distribution
  Nice for testing/unstable mix environment (but slow, perl script)
* GRUB
  http://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/l-grub/l-grub-3-6.html
  http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
* digital camera = www.gphoto.org 
  Also note that any camera with removable media will work with Linux
  through USB Mass Storage-compatible readers.
  These X-fun apps needs to be summarized in separate documents.
* Abiword font change (Not elegant)
1) use dpkg-divert to remove the default Abiword's fonts dir
   (/usr/share/AbiSuite/fonts)
2) add a symlink to the local TTF dir 
  (/usr/share/AbiSuite/fonts -> /usr/local/share/fonts/MS_ttfonts)
  --> defoma should take care of this by now.  So probably not a good tip.


=== TODO ===

Current situation of Translation:
* Serious spelling and grammar check (continuous)
* French, Italian (done as working version)
* Spanish, ... (50% done)
* Finnish, ... (started)
* German, ... (started)
* Japanese (My native tongue :)

* Thinking about using po-debiandoc by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org> 
  to manage translation.

Please join me if you care.
Any solid patch file will be appreciated.

OLD README:
This "qref" project in sourceforge.net is organized by
  Osamu Aoki <debian@aokiconsulting.com>

Update can be done by anyone who has CVS write access.
Drop me an e-mail with your sourceforge account name.  I will
add you to CVS write access.  Initial file tree will be built by me.

Look into documentation of boot-floppies and learn how to use CVS.

If you take over, get permission from previous person by mail.
Using your own branch for frequent update if you are not maintainer 
of that tree.  All communication shall be done through:

  qref-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

This is a very loose lock and supposedly relies on respect.

Once debian-packages are made, BTS shall be used as much as possible.

Eventually, I want to move to the DDP CVS site but not yet.
CVS archive at sourceforge is open to everyone.

Private ML for developers:
