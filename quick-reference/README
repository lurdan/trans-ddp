Known problems:
* ext3 root can not be remounted.  -386 kernel etc has ext2 as compiled-in
  making root ext2.  Note /proc/mounts, /proc/filesystem etc. to figure out 
  problem.
* date is in English.
* significant editorial contribution by David Sewell needs noted.
* swap file can be bigger than 128MB for newer kernels (>2.1.?)
* HD optimization "hdparm" need entry
* Some parts of translated documents contain English. (Send me translation)

Action plan:
* Use po-debiandoc by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>.
