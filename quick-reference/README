Known problems and needed additions:

=== KNOWN BUG ===
* date is all in English. (Ugly)
* Some parts of translated documents contain English. (Send me translation)
* support.sgml releasenote is not in package, etc.
* FIXME section

=== TIPS ===
* CUPS
  edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. then "links http://localhost:631".
* procmail to filter duplicates
  $ man procmailex
  / dupl RET
* "less" to read gzipped text files automatically, 
  read /usr/doc/less/LESSOPEN
* print web page
  $ apt-get install html2ps
  $ html2ps <URL> | lpr
* pid of software: "man 8 pidof"

=== TIPS not good enough ===
* apt-show-versions: Lists available package versions with distribution
  Nice for testing/unstable mix environment (but slow, perl script)
* GRUB
  http://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/l-grub/l-grub-3-6.html
* digital camera = www.gphoto.org 
  Also note that any camera with removable media will work with Linux
  through USB Mass Storage-compatible readers.

=== INFO === 
* ext3 root can not be easily remounted.  Note /proc/mounts, 
  /proc/filesystem etc. to figure out problem. 
  Read bug # 135537 for good insight :)

=== INSTALL ===
* Set default domain to do 'ping host' not 'ping host.mydomain':
  add a 'search' directive to /etc/resolv.conf
* CD-ROM + CD-R/RW, Warren Dodge wrote:
  Add this line to your /etc/modutils/aliases file and run update-modules:
    pre-install      ide-scsi      modprobe ide-cd
  This causes the IDE driver to load before ide-scsi. It then takes control of
  the ATAPID CD-ROM -- anything that it hasn't been told to ignore. That leaves
  just the ignored devices for ide-scsi to control.

=== TODO ===
* More on ssh-agent
* DBS package for multi-patch source
* Dial-up info
* portmap
* Digital photo archive.
* Document reorganization (More logical chapters)
* groff example
* remove cvs tag

Current situation of Translation:

* Serious spell and grammar check (continuous)
* French, Italian (done)
* Spanish, ... (some done)
* Greman, ... if someone join.
* Japanese (My native tongue :)
* Thinking about using po-debiandoc by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org> 
  to manage translation.

OLD README:
This "qref" project in sourceforge.net is organized by
  Osamu Aoki <debian@aokiconsulting.com>

Update can be done by anyone who has CVS write access.
Drop me a e-mail with your sourceforge account name.  I will
add you to CVS write access.  Initial file tree will be build by me.

Look into documentation of boot-floppies and lean how to use CVS.

If you take over, get permission from previous person by mail.
Using your own branch for frequent update if you are not maintainer 
of that tree.  All communication shall be dome through:

  qref-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

This is very loose lock and supposedly relies on respect.

Once debian-package are made, BTS shall be used as much as possible.

Eventually, I want to move to the DDP CVS site but not yet.
CVS archive at sourceforge is open to everyone.

Private ML for developers:
   qref-developers@lists.sourceforge.net
