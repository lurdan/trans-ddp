== BUGS ==

If you find any issues or shortcomings of this DR, please file bug reports
using reportbug command against "debian-reference" package.  See also,
http://bugs.debian.org for how Debian BTS works.

For bug report, it is strongly recommended to write what you want as
alternative.  "It does not work...", "I can do this...", etc. are not so
useful.  "This section should be rewritten as ...." is desiarable style.

For simple grammar errors and spell errors, diff against plain text file or
the source file are most appreciated.

Of course, updating Debian DDP subversion repository with right patch is 
most appreciated.

== TODO ==

* Close CVS at SF.NET
* Remove use of asciidoc from original raw.xml preparation.

== SOURCE ==
