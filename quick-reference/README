* FIXME sections ("XXX FIXME XXX") in source
* Quick reference is only available in English, French(, German)
* Greman, Finnish, Portoguese are unfiniashed

=== TIPS to be included soon ===

* iptable tutorials
  check http://www.linuxguruz.org/ especially /iptables/
  Also kernel source Documentation/networking/*

* Wine tutorials

* upgrade with apt-get

  (per Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>)
  Perhaps you're updating with 'apt-get update' rather than 'dselect
  update', and then using some tool (like 'dpkg -p' or dselect) that
  expects dpkg's available database to be up-to-date? 

* fbset for all ttys
  # fbset -t 13334 144 24 29 3 136 6 -a

* two-sided and two-in-one printing of PDF
  gv: 
   print even and odd pages
  mpage
    env variable set to "-bA4 -t -T -2 -Pprn0008" for double-sided A4 with 
    two pages to each sheet
  a2ps is alternative to mpage
  
  CUPS (per Derrick 'dman' Hudson <dman@dman.ddts.net>)
    1) print to file
    2) lp -o number-up=2 -o page-set=even
    3) reinsert pages in printer
    4) lp -o number-up=2 -o page-set=odd

* kernel header files for user application (only updated in English)

* mouse config (only updated in English)

* Max date on 32 bit Unix/Linux: 2038-01-18 19:14:07

* GIF and UNISYS issue
GIMP issues are already answered but let me draw your attention to the
UNISYS issue.

   http://www.ora.com/infocenters/gff/gff-faq/

I never used it but there are utilities called ungif in Debian.  That
may be what you want :)

   $ apt-cache search ungif

With this, you can use GIF like the Debian website :-)
(We all know the GNU site does not like using these non-LZW GIFs
either.)

* Package split scenario (Check NM/Dev REF)
The groff split example:
  Potato:
    groff
  Woody:
    groff-base Suggests: groff, groff-x11
    groff Depends: groff-base, Suggests: groff-x11
    groff-x11 Depends: groff-base, Suggests: groff

* memwatch (memory test)
It is listed on the GNU site.
 http://www.gnu.org/directory/devel/debug/
 http://www.gnu.org/directory/devel/debug/memwatch.html
   
* digital camera = www.gphoto.org 
  Also note that any camera with removable media will work with Linux
  through USB Mass Storage-compatible readers.
  These X-fun apps needs to be summarized in separate documents.

=== TODO ===

Current situation of Translation:
* Serious spelling and grammar check (continuous)
* French, Italian (done as working version)
* Spanish, ... (50% done)
* Finnish, ... (started)
* German, ... (started)
* Japanese (My native tongue :)

* Thinking about using po-debiandoc by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org> 
  to manage translation.

Please join me if you care.
Any solid patch file will be appreciated.

OLD README:
This "qref" project in sourceforge.net is organized by
  Osamu Aoki <debian@aokiconsulting.com>

Update can be done by anyone who has CVS write access.
Drop me an e-mail with your sourceforge account name.  I will
add you to CVS write access.  Initial file tree will be built by me.

Look into documentation of boot-floppies and learn how to use CVS.

If you take over, get permission from previous person by mail.
Using your own branch for frequent update if you are not maintainer 
of that tree.  All communication shall be done through:

  qref-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

This is a very loose lock and supposedly relies on respect.

Once debian-packages are made, BTS shall be used as much as possible.

Eventually, I want to move to the DDP CVS site but not yet.
CVS archive at sourceforge is open to everyone.

Private ML for developers:
   qref-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

Development homepage:
   http://qref.sourceforge.net/doc
