Known problems:
* ext3 root can not be remounted.  -386 kernel etc has ext2 as compiled-in
  making root ext2.  Note /proc/mounts, /proc/filesystem etc. to figure out 
  problem.
* date is in English.
* significant editorial contribution by David Sewell needs noted.
* swap file can be bigger than 128MB for newer kernels (>2.1.?)
* HD optimization "hdparm" need entry
* Some parts of translated documents contain English. (Send me translation)

Action plan:
* Use po-debiandoc by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>.

Environment requirement:
Setup TeX:  Needs big pool size (installed values x4)

/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf
...
% Max number of characters in all strings, including all error messages,
% help texts, font names, control sequences.  These values apply to TeX and MP.
pool_size.context = 3000000
pool_size = 500000
% Minimum pool space after TeX/MP's own strings; must be at least
% 25000 less than pool_size, but doesn't need to be nearly that large.
string_vacancies.context = 180000
string_vacancies = 100000
% Maximum number of strings.
max_strings.context = 220000
max_strings = 60000
% min pool space left after loading .fmt
pool_free.context = 200000
pool_free = 20000
...

Any solid patch file appreciated.
