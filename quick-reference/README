Known problems:
* ext3 root can not be easily remounted.  -386 kernel etc has ext2 as 
  compiled-in making root ext2.  Note /proc/mounts, /proc/filesystem etc. 
  to figure out problem. Read bug # 135537 for good insight :)
* date is in English. (Ugly)
* significant editorial contribution by David Sewell needs noted.
* swap file can be bigger than 128MB for newer kernels (>2.1.?)
* HD optimization "hdparm" needs entry
   "hdparm -tT /dev/hda" and "hdparm -d1 -c1 -m16 -u1  /dev/hda" with good
   warning.
* Some parts of translated documents contain English. (Send me translation)
* This does not build automatically (See "Environment requirement" below)
  Bug #148470
* USB mouse info.
* apt.conf tip
   $ cat >> /etc/apt/apt.conf
   // Always show packages to be upgraded (-u).
   APT::Get::Show-Upgraded "true";
   ^D
* Java plugin for Mozilla/Galeon

  The temporary fix for sysadmins could be
    DPkg::Post-Install-Pkgs {"xargs /usr/bin/debsums -sg";};
  in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90debsums (untested).


Action plan:
* Use po-debiandoc by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>.
  http://people.debian.org/~barbier/devel/po-debiandoc/

Environment requirement:
Setup TeX:  Needs big pool size (installed values x4)

/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf
...
% Max number of characters in all strings, including all error messages,
% help texts, font names, control sequences.  These values apply to TeX and MP.
pool_size.context = 3000000
pool_size = 500000
% Minimum pool space after TeX/MP's own strings; must be at least
% 25000 less than pool_size, but doesn't need to be nearly that large.
string_vacancies.context = 180000
string_vacancies = 100000
% Maximum number of strings.
max_strings.context = 220000
max_strings = 60000
% min pool space left after loading .fmt
pool_free.context = 200000
pool_free = 20000
...

Any solid patch file appreciated.
