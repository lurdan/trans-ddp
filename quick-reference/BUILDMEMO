* Why can I only build in txt and html but not in ps or pdf?
Usually encoding issue. "konwert" is very useful fixing these using 
any/??-iso1 filter as found in bin/isofix in this tree.  We need files 
to be ISO-8859-1.  Not UTF-8.  Be careful, please.
Also iconv and recode can be used.  One of the following will fix 
UTF-8 into ISO-8859-1.  (See bin/isofix for convert all script)

 $ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-1 somefile.utf8 -o somefile.sgml
 $ konwert any/de-iso1 somefile.utf8 -o somefile.sgml
 $ recode UTF-8..ISO-8859-1 somefile.sgml

* EMACS and ISO-8859-1 / UTF-8 problem.

To set language mode,

    (set-language-environment "Latin-1")

may help you in such a case.  And more, writing

     -*-coding: iso-8859-1;-*-

should fix it.

Also you can force emacs to save in iso-8859-1 in making :

 C-x RET c

 iso-8859-1

 and then C-x C-s

You may even try to start like (Please verify success report)

 $ LANG=it_IT.ISO-8859-1 LC_CTYPE=it_IT.ISO-8859-1 emacs

* Translation version check.
If you use doc-copy to create starting template and translate them into
any language, you can check version by doc-check.  Even if you did not 
use doc-copy, you can still do version check as long as header (See French
translation for example) are maintained in the same format.

* Translation guide line

Read as much Debian web site and other translations to make sure wording 
are consistent with current convention.

Please do not forget to update bin/getdocdate if you add support for a new
language.

* How to add language specific content.
If it involves no new chapter/section/paragraph/item/ tags, just 
sneak in anything.

For example I think addition of:
(NdT: Pour les francophones, vous trouverez de l'aide en vous abonnant à 
 la liste de discussion francophone 
 debian-user-french-request@lists.debian.org.) 

is good :-)

If you need additional chapter, talk to everyone for your intent.

Make section or something like that.  make that as language enabled 
conditional section in English.  Add that to all language.

This way, even if po-debiandoc or similar tools are used, it can be 
compatible. (I think)

For other translators, do not bother translating those section in that 
language selective section.
