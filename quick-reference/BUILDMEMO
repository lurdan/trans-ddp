* Why can I only build in txt and html but not in ps or pdf.
Usually encoding issue. "konwert" is very useful fixing these using 
any/??-iso1 filter as found in bin/isofix in this tree.

* Translation version check.
If you use doc-copy to create starting template and translate them into
any language, you can check version by doc-check.  Even if you did not 
use doc-copy, you can still do version check as long as header (See French
translation for example) are maintained in the same format.
