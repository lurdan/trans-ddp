<sect id="convention">Document conventions
<p>
"&book-title" document provides information through short BASH shell 
commands. Here is the conventions used:
<example>
# command in root account
$ command in user account
... description of action
</example>
Since this document was started as a "quick" reference, information
included may only be a reminder or a pointer to the authoritative 
one.  
<p>
In case of &ldp; being the source of information, it is indicated
with the name of the HOWTO, such as <em>Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO</em> (LDP).  
This can be found under <file>&howtohome;</file> as a text file with 
<tt>.gz</tt> extention if <package>&howtopackage</package> has been 
installed. Also latest copy can be obtained from <url id="&ldphome;" 
name="&ldp;">.
<p>
In case of &ddp; being the source of information, it is indicated
with name of the document package, such as <package>apt-howto</package>.  
Latest copy can be obtained from <url id="&ddphome;" name="&ddp;">.
<p>
In case of installation manual being the source of information, 
read the official documents found at 
<url id="&debianhome;releases/stable/installmanuals" 
name="&urlname"> or 
follow links from
<url id="&debianhome;" name="&urlname">.
<p>
Documentation on a particular package is usually located under 
<file>&dochome;packagename/</file>.  Also, <prgn>man</prgn> or 
<prgn>info</prgn> commands may provide information on a program.
It may require coresponding document package such as 
<package>samba-doc</package> to be installed to access its documentation.
<p>
For BASH, read <prgn>man bash</prgn> and <file>Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO</file>
as starter.
<p>
<url id="&example1home;" 
name="Examples of scripts are available here on the web. Hidden files with 
preceding . are converted to preceding _">.
<p>
Woody or newer version of Debian system with following packages 
installed are assumed in this document.
<example>
# apt-get install debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
       doc-debian doc-linux-text apt-howto info glibc-doc \
       man-db manpages manpages-dev less mc # ...
</example>
Except for the multiple package source handling capabilities of APT, 
most of the contents are applicable to the older potato, too.  
For potato system, <package>apt-howto</package> does not exist,
so ommit it but include <package>packaging-manual</package>.
</sect>

<sect>Prerequisite readings
<p>
It is highly recommended to read few key documents:
<list>
<item>Install manual: contains all the basics for installation.
<list>
<item>Web: <url id="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/i386/install" 
name="&urlname;">
<item>Package: <package>install-doc</package>
<item>File: <file>/usr/share/doc/install-doc/index.html</file>
</list>
<item>Release note: must be read even if you know debian.
<list>
<item>Web: <url id="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/i386/release-notes/" 
name="&urlname;">
<item>Package: <package>install-doc</package>
<item>File: <file>/usr/share/doc/install-doc/upgrade-i386.html [FIXME]</file>
</list>
<item>FAQ: frequently asked questions.
<list>
<item>Web: <url id="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/" 
name="&urlname;">
<item>Package: <package>doc-debian</package>, 
<item>File: <file>/usr/share/doc/debian/FAQ/index.html</file>
</list>

<sect>Basics of the Debian distributions
<p>
Debian comes in 3 release "flavors": 
<list>
<item>stable:   Good to track on a production server. Boring for the workstation (WS).
<item>testing:  Good to track on the WS (read debian-devel-announce for
updates).
<item>unstable: Never track this unless you know what you're doing.  Use it to
selectively upgrade packages for particular reasons.
</list>
As of January 2002, these correspond to Potato (production quality),
Woody (beta-test, very stable now), and Sid (alpha-test).  When packages
in unstable have no Release Critical (RC) bugs filed against them 
after the first week or
so, they are automatically promoted to testing. 
<p>
In theory, there are two things you can do get the latest versions of software
running.  <p>
<ref id="apt-install"> (mainly for WS purposes)
<p>
<ref id="port"> (mainly for server purposes)
<p>
After explaining some fundamentals of Debian distribution in 
<ref id="system">, I will present some basic information here to 
help you live happily with the
latest software, taking advantage of the testing and unstable distributions of
Debian. The impatient should proceed to <ref id="survival"> immediately.
Happy upgrading!
