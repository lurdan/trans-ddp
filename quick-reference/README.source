I will touch on following topics.

 * Quick guide
 * Document style
 * Basics of build process
 * What is @@@ in asciidoc
 * What is @-@ in asciidoc and raw XML
 * Making copy of SVN contents
 * Updating contents in English XML source
 * Fixing typo in English XML source
 * Updating remote data contents
 * Creating Translation PO for a new language
 * Updating Translation PO
 * Updating for new release (squeeze --> squeeze+1)
 * Utilities (split PO, spell check etc.)
 * VCS locations and history

== Quick guide ==

Please note that for http://www.debian.org/ web site publishing, XML/PO
files are used to build pages.  Before committing, please do this.

 * Update from SVN to get the latest source: "svn co" or "svn up"
 * Fix fuzzy in PO using via poedit GUI etc.
 * Update XML/PO files.
   * If updated English ascoodoc: "make xml"
   * If updated translation PO only: "make po"
 * Fix fuzzy in PO using via poedit GUI etc.
 * Generate HTML to check result.
   * If updated English ascoodoc: "make all"
   * If updated translation PO only: "make po-test"

Please note old translated documents are in SGML and its content is very
loosely related to current English content.  In order to recycle as much
old content, I usually use followings:
   
 * "poedit" to edit debian-reference.??.po file to be updated.
 * browser to display debian-reference.??.html from sage/lenny package
 * copy-and-paste to po file (via poedit GUI)
 * add XML tags as needed

== Document style ==

Besides things mentioned in "About this document" in Preface,
I used IBM Style Guide (IBM_Style_27Apr09.pdf) from IBM site: 
 URL:    http://www.ibm.com/software/ucd/files/IBM_Style_27Apr09.pdf
 ( You may wish to check newer version linked from:
   URL:    http://www.ibm.com/software/ucd/otherresources.html )

Currently, there is big gap.  I will slowly polish this document to be
compliant as possible.

There are exceptions. 
 * I use Latin acronyms: e.g., etc., i.e., read/write
 * I use lines starting with number

== Basics of build process ==

You must have lenny system with following packages installed:
 * subversion
 * pbuilder
 * asciidoc (only if you update English)
 * libxml2-utils
 * devscripts
 * wget
 * dctrl-tools
 * Files in debian/control Build-Depends

Basic flow of build process can be summarized as:

       all the asciidoc/*.txt files and remotely fetched files by wget
                   :(asciidoc @ lenny version)       :
                   :(build from asciidoc by          :
                   : "make xml" or "make all")       :
                   v                                 v
  >>> debian-reference.raw.xml --> url.ent and other *.ent
      (source XML) :(build from raw.xml by "make po" or "make po-test")
                   v
      debian-reference.en.xml -->  all English final formats (HTML, text)
      debian-reference.en.xmlt \   (This removes untranslating part)  
      (XML file)   |         \  \
                   v          \  \
      debian-reference.pot     +--+-> debian-reference.ja.xml
      (POT file)   |          /           |
                   v         /            v
  >>> debian-reference.ja.po       all Japanese final formats (HTML, text)
      (PO file)

Please note po files are generated from English
debian-reference.en.xmlt.  This debian-reference.en.xmlt is an XML file
very similar to debian-reference.en.xml which isalso XML file.
Untranslatable contents in debian-reference.en.xml is replaced by
"DUMMY" to reduce clutter in PO file.

Please note actual build process starts from debian-reference.raw.xml and
debian-reference.ja.po files.  These are "REAL" source files as far as
package build process and www.debian.org web page building process by
ddp are concerned.

Asciidoc format is used as a helper to make debian-reference.raw.xml
source with minimum typing.   This will be dropped once squeeze is out.
After squeeze release, debian-reference.raw.xml will be the source.

Due to asciidoc conversion logic differences, we must use lenny version
of asciidoc for this source.  Otherwise you get different output to the
raw.xml and break all the po files.

Please note Makefile has few key parameters which affects build process.

  BUILD_MODE := xml       (normal-build-from-raw-xml mode, default)
  BUILD_MODE := asciidoc  (build-from-asciidoc mode, use this via "all" "xml" target in lenny)

  PDIR       := something   for normal build situation
  PDIR       := ddp-svn     for /org/www.debian.org/ddp-svn/trunk/quick-reference

  PUBLISHDIR := build result file location

  LANGALL    := language list for all
  LANGPO     := language list for PO based translation
  LANGSGML   := language list for SGML based old translation (calculated)

Please note following targets:

make all
        Update source from asciidoc
	Results are in $(PUBLISHDIR)
	Do not require remote connection if you already have done so.

make xml
	Create XML/PO source files from asciidoc

make po-test
	Results are in $(PUBLISHDIR)
	Build html etc using current raw.xml and po files

make po
	Update PO files from raw.xml

make publish
	Used by DDP for www.debian.org
	Do not require remote connection nor asciidoc

make html
	Create html files

make txt
	Create txt files

make css
	Create css files

make clean
	Clean source to make it ready for packaging

make distclean
	Clean source to make it ready to be updated remotely

make update
	Update source with remote data.

== What is @@@ in asciidoc ==

You see quite a bit of @@@ in asciidoc source.  That is placed there
when idiosyncrasy of asciidoc hit me.  Asciidoc to raw.xml conversion
result is filtered with sed script bin/replace to get right characters
into a resulting XML file (debian-reference.en.raw) without worrying
about asciidoc converting to something funny.

For example: @@@sq@@@ is converted to ' 

These conversion occur right after asciidoc conversion but before
storing to raw.xml files.  So this is purely work around for asciidoc
idiosyncrasies.

== What is @-@ in asciidoc and raw XML ==

You see quite a bit of @-@ in asciidoc and generated XML source.  That
is placed there when auto-generated data replaces them as entity in the
final form (*.xml, *.po, *.tml, ...).

For example: @-@foo@-@     is converted to &foo;
             @-@popcon1@-@ is converted to popcon value and URL link of
                                           package in column 1.
             @-@psize1@-@  is converted to size value and URL link of
                                           package in column 1.
             @-@popcon2@-@ is converted to popcon value and URL link of
                                           package in column 2.
             @-@psize2@-@  is converted to size value and URL link of
                                           package in column 2.

These survive asciidoc conversion but are transformed from raw.xml to
en.xml.

== Making copy of SVN contents  ==

If you just need readonly access to SVN contents, you can do this  with:
 $ mkdir -p path/to/use/
 $ cd path/to/use/
 $ svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/ddp/manuals/trunk/quick-reference qref

If you need read/write access, please follow me ...

DR is part of Debian Documentation Project (DDP) at
http://www.debian.org/doc/ddp . 

DDP uses alioth service.  

If you do not have alioth account (i.e. non DD), you can set up by
clicking "New account" at the top right corner.

You can join DDP by clicking [Request to join] at
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/ddp/ and send your request to join.
You should send short reminder to debian-doc@lists.debian.org .  Then
you can get alioth account activated for DDP.  Please use English page
etc.  (Otherwise we get non-English message)

You should set up SSH (passwordless login).  Then:

 $ mkdir -p path/to/use/
 $ cd path/to/use/
 $ svn co svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/ddp/manuals/trunk/qick-reference qref

== Updating contents in English XML source ==

Typical work flow of creating latest XML source from asciidoc/po4a is:

 * Get latest source with "svn up" to sync with latest upstream.
 * Edit "asciidoc/*.txt" files to update English contents if needed.
 * Run "make xml".
   -->  It runs msgmerge for you.
 * Edit "po4a/debian-reference.??.po" to update translation if needed.
   --> remove "fuzzy" while fixing translation.
 * Run "make all" for test build html,
   --> If error, back to Edit "asciidoc/*.txt" files.
 * Save updated XML source with "svn ci".

 * Clean source as needed with "make clean".

 * Test build package using "debuild" and "pdebuild".

For editing "po4a/debian-reference.??.po", use specialized po file 
editor such as poedit for ease.

== Fixing typo in English XML source ==

If you find typo in English and you know its fix should not affects
translation, you can do following:

 * Get latest source with "svn up".
 * Fix source as neeeded for merge errors.
 * Run "make xml" to be sure.
   via poedit GUI-->  It runs msgmerge for you.
 * Save updated XML source with "svn ci" to sync with upstream.
 * Edit "asciidoc/*.txt" files to typo English contents if needed.
 * Run "make typo".
   -->  It runs msguntypot for you.
 * Run "make all" for test build html
   --> If error, back to Edit "asciidoc/*.txt" files.
 * Save updated XML source with "svn ci".

== Updating remote data contents ==

You need remote connection to update popcon, package size, and other remotely
fetched data.

 * Get latest source with "svn up".
 * Run "make distclean" to remove remote data contents.
 * Run "make all" for test build html
 * Save updated XML source with "svn ci".

== Creating Translation PO for a new language ==

 * Get latest source with "svn up".
 * Run "make xml" to be sure.
 * Run "cd po4a; cp debian-reference.pot debian-reference.??.po".
 * Save updated XML source with "svn ci".

To test run for language ??, "make xml LANGPO=??".

Once translation becomes in good shape, update LANGPO value in Makefile to 
include ?? .

== Updating Translation PO ==

 * Get latest source with "svn up".
 * Run "make xml" to be sure.
 * Edit "po4a/debian-reference.??.po" to update translation if needed.
 * Run "make all" for test build html,
   --> If error, back to Edit "po4a/debian-reference.??.po" files.
 * Save updated XML source with "svn ci".

== Updating for new release (squeeze --> squeeze+1) ==

 * Update common.ent target in Makefile to new release names.
 * Change English source to debian-reference.raw.xml or other pre-XML 
   format.

== Utilities (split PO etc.) ==

There are few utilities scripts I use to maintain this package.  Here are ones
you may be interested to use in utils/ directory.  You have to add this 
directory to $PATH by:

 PATH=/path/to/utils/:${PATH}
 export PATH

* "po4a-strip" to remove translator field from PO file.

  po4a-strip file-in.po >file-out.po

* "po4a-split" to split PO file into several chunks

 po4a-split <chunks> file.po

* spell check efficiently using "wordlist"

 zcat debian-reference.en.txt.gz | wordlist > word.txt
 gedit word.txt
 (autospell check)
 find bad word
 use grep to find text using it
 fix

== VCS locations and history ==

This DR source is maintained in alioth ddp SVN repository now.

VCS usage of Debian Reference (DR) have been changed with time.
This can be summarized approximately as follows:

 1. DR ver 1 (ALL SGML source)
  * Souceforge CVS as primary
  * ddp CVS having copy of Souceforge CVS
 2. DR ver 2 (lenny) (XML=English source, SGML=other sources)
  * Souceforge CVS stalled
  * ddp CVS having copy of old Souceforge CVS
    --> This was moved to ddp SVN
  * git.debian.org having latest source
 3. DR ver 2 (squeeze) (XML=English Japanese sources, SGML=other sources)
  * Souceforge CVS stalled
  * ddp SVN latest content
  * git.debian.org stalled

Latest SVN repository contents can be inspected/cloned as:
 $ svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/ddp/manuals/trunk manuals     # SVN     (ro)
 $ svn co svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/ddp/manuals/trunk manuals # SVN+SSH (r/w)
 http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/ddp/manuals/trunk/quick-reference/
 http://www-master.debian.org/build-logs/ddp/                  DDP build results

Latest source source package can be downloaded by
 $ apt-get source debian-reference

Older lenny GIT repository contents can be inspected/cloned as:
 $ sensible-browser http://git.debian.org/?p=users/osamu/debian-reference.git              # web
 $ git clone  ssh://git.debian.org/~osamu/public_git/debian-reference.git debian-reference # r/w
 $ git clone  ssh://git.debian.org/git/users/osamu/debian-reference.git   debian-reference # r/w
 $ git clone  git://git.debian.org/~osamu/debian-reference.git            debian-reference # ro
 $ git clone  git://git.debian.org/git/users/osamu/debian-reference.git   debian-reference # ro
