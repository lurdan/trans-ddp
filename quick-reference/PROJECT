This "qref" project in sourceforge.net is organized by
  Osamu Aoki <debian@aokiconsulting.com>

Update can be done by anyone who has CVS write access.
Drop me a e-mail with your sourceforge account name.  I will
add you to CVS write access.  Initial file tree will be build by me.

Look into documentation of boot-floppies and lean how to use CVS.

If you take over, get permission from previous person by mail.
Using your own branch for frequent update if you are not maintainer 
of that tree.  All communication shall be dome through:

  qref-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

This is very loose lock and supposedly relies on respect.

Once debian-package are made, BTS shall be used as much as possible.

Eventually, I want to move to the DDP CVS site but not yet.
CVS archive at sourceforge is open to everyone.

Private ML for developers:
   qref-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

Development homepage:
