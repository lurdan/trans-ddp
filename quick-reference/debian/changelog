debian-reference (1.05-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * FTBFS: Build failure of debian-reference on i386, closes: #167049
    I think filing "Serious" bug against functional "all" package is 
    counter productive.  I fixed it now until new tetex-bin/extra 
    breaks this to be FTBFS. Sigh.
  * Fix version number in the document. (Bug in rules.)
  * PCMCIA NIC and network in Woody described.
  * CUPS, Mouse section improved.
  * Add autoinstall, merge pdf/ps file, secure password, ...
  * New source tree without debian/ and use cvs-buildpackage
  * Conform to a newer directory structure after the debian-doc discussion.
    This is still tentative.
  * New maintainer. Me :-)  My thanks to my sponsor Ramakrishnan M.
