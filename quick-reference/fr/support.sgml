<chapt id="support">Getting support for &debian;

<p> There are many sources of help, advice and support for Debian
users, but these should only be considered if research into
documentation of the issue has exhausted all sources. This section
provides a short introduction into these which may be helpful for
new Debian users.

<sect id="debiandocs">Primary documentations for Debian

<p><list>
  <item>Installation instructions for the current release:  see
    <url id="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install">.
  <item>Packaging manual is the primary documentation on the technical
    aspects of creating Debian binary and source packages.
    <p>You can find it in the <package/packaging-manual/ package, or at
    <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/packaging.html.tar.gz">.
  <item>Policy manual documents the policy requirements for the
    distribution, i.e. the structure and contents of the Debian archive,
    several design issues of the operating system, as well as technical
    requirements that each package must satisfy to be included in the
    distribution.
    <p>Get it from the <package/debian-policy/ package, or at
    <url id="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/policy.html.tar.gz">.
  <item>Documentation on installed Debian packages:
    Most packages have files that are unpacked into <tt>/usr/doc/PACKAGE</tt>.
  <item>Documentation on the Linux project:
    The Debian package <package/doc-linux/ installs all of the most recent
    versions of the HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs from the <url name="Linux
    Documentation Project" id="http://www.linuxdoc.org">.
  <item>Unix-style `man' pages:  Most commands have manual pages written in
    the style of the original Unix 'man' files. They are referenced by the
    section of the 'man' directory where they reside: e.g., foo(3) refers
    to a manual page which resides in /usr/share/man/man3/, and it can be
    called by executing the command: <tt>man 3 foo</tt>, or just
    <tt>man foo</tt> if section 3 is the first one containing a page on
    <tt>foo</tt>.
    <p>One can learn which directory of <tt>/usr/share/man/</tt> contains
    a certain manual page by executing <tt>man -w foo</tt>.
    <p>New Debian users should note that the 'man' pages of many general
    system commands are not available until they install these packages:
    <list>
      <item><tt>man-db</tt>, which contains the <tt>man</tt> program
        itself, and other programs for manipulating the manual pages.
      <item><tt>manpages</tt>, which contains the system manual pages.
        (see <ref id="nonenglish">).
    </list>
  <item>GNU-style `info' pages:  User documentation for many commands,
    particularly GNU tools, is available not in `man' pages, but in `info'
    files which can be read by the GNU tool <tt>info</tt>, by running
    <tt>M-x info</tt> within GNU Emacs, or with some other Info page viewer.
    <p>Its main advantage over the original `man' pages are that it is
    a hypertext system.  It does <em>not</em> require the WWW, however;
    <tt>info</tt> can be run from a plain text console.  It was designed
    by Richard Stallman and preceded the WWW.
</list>

<p>Note that you may access a lot of documentation on your system by using a
WWW browser, through `dwww' or `dhelp' commands, found in respective
packages.

<sect id="lists">Mailing lists
        <p>The mailing lists of most interest to Debian users are the
        debian-user (English) and other debian-user-<var/language/ lists
        (for other languages). For information on these lists and details of
        how to subscribe see <url id="http://lists.debian.org">. Please
        check the archives for answers to your question prior to posting and
        also adhere to standard list etiquette.</p>

<sect id="irc">Internet Relay Chat
        
        <p>Debian has an IRC channel dedicated to the support and aid of
        Debian users located on the Open Projects IRC network which is
        dedicated to providing collaborative information sharing resources
        for the Open Source community. To access the channel point your
        favourite IRC client at irc.openprojects.net and join #debian.</p>
        
        <p>Please follow the channel guidelines, respecting other users
        fully. For more information on Open Projects please visit the <url
        id="http://www.openprojects.net" name="website">.</p>

<sect id="searchtools">Search Engines

<p>There are many search engines that serve documentation related
to Debian:

<list>
  <item><url id="http://search.debian.org/" name="Debian WWW search site">.

  <item><url id="http://groups.google.com/" name="Google Groups">: a search
    engine for newsgroups.

    <p>For example, to find out what experiences people have had with
    finding drivers for Promise controllers under Debian, try searching on
    the phrase <tt>Promise Linux driver</tt>. This will show you all the
    postings that contain these strings, i.e. those where people discussed
    these topics. If you add <tt>Debian</tt> to those search strings, you'll
    also get the postings specifically related to Debian.

  <item>Any of the common web spidering engines, such as
    <url id="http://www.altavista.com/" name="AltaVista"> or
    <url id="http://www.google.com/" name="Google">, as long as you use
    the right search terms.

    <p>For example, searching on the string "cgi-perl" gives a more detailed
    explanation of this package than the brief description field in its
    control file.
</list>

<sect id="buglogs">Debian bug tracking system

<p>The &debian; distribution has a bug tracking system (BTS) which files
details of bugs reported by users and developers. Each bug is given a
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with.

<p>Copies of this information are available at
<url id="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">.

<p>A mail server provides access to the bug tracking system database via
e-mail.  In order to get the instructions, send an e-mail to
request@bugs.debian.org with "help" in the body.

<sect id="bugreport">Reporting a bug to Debian

<p>If you have found a bug in Debian, please read the instructions for
reporting a bug in Debian.  These instructions can be obtained in one of
several ways:
<list>
  <item>By anonymous FTP.  Debian mirror sites contain the instructions in
  the file <tt>doc/bug-reporting.txt</tt>.
  <item>From the WWW.  A copy of the instructions is shown at
  <url id="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting">.
  <item>On any Debian system with the <package/doc-debian/ package installed.
  The instructions are in the file
  <file>/usr/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt</file>.
</list>

<p>You can use the packages <package/bug/ or <package/reportbug/ that will
guide you through the reporting process and mail the message to the proper
address, with some extra details about your system added automatically.

<p>If you want to mail the report with a MUA, send a message to
<email/submit@bugs.debian.org/, first line of which containing a line like
  <example>Package: packagename</example>
(replace "packagename" with the name of the package). The rest of the
message should contain the description of the bug (please make it moderately
detailed), Debian release you are using, and versions of that and relevant
packages.

<p>Expect to get an automatic acknowledgement of your bug report. It will
also be automatically given a bug tracking number, entered into the bug
log and forwarded to the debian-bugs-dist mailing list.

<p>If one were to identify a bug that was common to many programs, then
rather than entering dozens of very similar bug reports, one might prefer to
send individual bugs to <email/maintonly@bugs.debian.org/ (instead of the
submit@... address) to reach only the respective package maintainers, and
then send a summary report to debian-devel and/or debian-bugs-dist mailing
lists.

<p>Additionally, there exists a Debian package checker, called
<url name="Lintian" id="http://www.debian.org/lintian/">, which is
designed to mechanically check Debian packages for policy violations and
common packaging errors. Thus, if you detect a bug in a package which is
likely to appear in other packages too, it might be better to get in
contact with the Lintian maintainers at <email/lintian-maint@debian.org/
so that a new check is written for Lintian instead of reporting the bug
directly. This will most likely prevent the bug to appear in future versions
of the package again, or in any other package of the distribution.

<p>You can also use <email/quiet@bugs.debian.org/, to submit bug reports to
the BTS only, without having them sent either to debian-bugs-dist or to the
maintainer. This `quiet' address is used very rarely, e.g. when you want to
send some minor data to your report, that should just be recorded in the
log, or when you want to record something in the BTS log but you already
sent it to the maintainer.
