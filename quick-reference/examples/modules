# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
#
# This file should contain the names of kernel modules that are
# to be loaded at boot time, one per line.  Comments begin with
# a #, and everything on the line after them are ignored.
#
# Many modules are needed to be loaded for Debian standard 2.4/2.6 kernel 
# imagess.
#
# The use of auto hardware detection package such as discover eliminates 
# needs for manually loading through this /etc/modules.  
#
# Also hotplug package loads modules at boot time.
#
# Some modules which are supposed to be loaded automatically may have
# timing issues and required to be pre-loaded here (network related ones).
#
# Since Linux kernel is moving target, these requirement may be eliminated 
# with newer kernels and utilities.  Just use this as secondary reference.
