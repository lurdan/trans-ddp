<appendix id="appendix">The Linux Maze

<![%FIXME[<p>===Proof reading by danielwebb [+dsew]: DONE ===]]>

<p>
The GNU/Linux system is a very powerful computing platform for a networked  
computer.  However, learning how to use all its capabilities is not easy. 
Setting up the printer is a good example.
<p>
There is a complete, detailed map called the "SOURCE CODE".  This is very
accurate but very hard to understand.  There are also references called
HOWTO and mini-HOWTO.  They are easier to understand but tend to give too 
much detail and lose the big picture.  I sometimes have a problem finding
the right section in a long HOWTO when I need a few commands to invoke.
<p>
In order to navigate through this maze of Linux system configuration, I started 
writing down simple reminder memos in text file format as my quick reference.
This list of memos grew larger and I learned debiandoc in the meantime.  The
product is this <em>&book-title;</em>.  
<p>
I made a conscious decision not to explain something if you can find it in
a man-page, info-page, or in HOWTO documents.  Also I tried not to explain but
to give more direct information by exact command sequences or example scripts.
The target audience is someone who can read shell scripts.
<p>
<em>Keep it short and simple</em> (KISS) is my guiding principle.
<p>
Since I am not an expert, I do not pretend to be fully knowledgeable about
Debian or Linux in general.  Security considerations I use are only applicable
for home use. This document does not replace any authoritative guides.
<p>
The original document is in Debiandoc SGML with each chapter organized
as a separate file. Original SGML to html, text, ps, and pdf conversions 
are done with the make script.  
<p>
Many ideas are taken from the "debian-user" mailing list.
