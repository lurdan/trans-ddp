&book-title; was initiated by Osamu Aoki &lt;debian@aokiconsulting.com&gt;
as a personal installation memo and eventually called "Quick Reference ...". 
Many contents came from the archives of debian-user mailing list.
Also "Debian -- Installation Manual" and "Debian -- Release Notes" 
were referenced.
<p>
Following suggestion from Josip Rodin who is very active at "Debian 
Documentation Project (DDP)" and the current maintainer of "Debian FAQ", 
this document was renamed as "Debian reference" and merged with several 
chapters from "Debian FAQ" with reference-like contents.

<sect id="maze">The &debian; maze

<![%FIXME[<p>===Proof reading by danielwebb [+dsew]: DONE ===]]>

<p>
The &debian; system is a very powerful computing platform for a networked  
computer.  However, learning how to use all its capabilities is not easy. 
Setting up the printer is a good example.
<p>
There is a complete, detailed map called the "SOURCE CODE".  This is very
accurate but very hard to understand.  There are also references called
HOWTO and mini-HOWTO.  They are easier to understand but tend to give too 
much detail and lose the big picture.  I sometimes have a problem finding
the right section in a long HOWTO when I need a few commands to invoke.
<p>
In order to navigate through this maze of Linux system configuration, I started 
writing down simple reminder memos in text file format as my quick reference.
This list of memos grew larger and I learned debiandoc in the meantime.  The
product is this <em>&book-title;</em>.  
<p>
I made a conscious decision not to explain something if you can find it in
a man-page, info-page, or in HOWTO documents.  Also I tried not to explain but
to give more direct information by exact command sequences or example scripts.
The target audience is someone who can read shell scripts.
<p>
<em>Keep it short and simple</em> (KISS) is my guiding principle.
