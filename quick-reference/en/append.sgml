&book-title; was initiated by Osamu Aoki <email>&osamu;</email>
as a personal installation memo that was eventually called "Quick Reference ...". 
Many contents came from the archives of the "debian-user" mailing list.
Also "Debian Installation Manual" and "Debian Release Notes" 
were referenced.
<p>
Following a suggestion from Josip Rodin, who is very active with the 
<url id="&ddp;" name="Debian Documentation Project"> (DDP) and is the current
maintainer of "The Debian FAQ", this document was renamed as "&full-title;"
and was merged with several chapters from the "The Debian FAQ" with reference-like
contents.  Then "&quick-title;" was formed as an excerpt.
<p> 
This document has been edited, translated, and expanded by the 
following QREF team members:

<p>
QREF was short for the original document title, "Quick Reference..."
and also is the project name at qref.sourceforge.net.
<p>
Many manual pages and info pages on the &debian; system were used as the
primary references to write this document.  To the extent Osamu Aoki
considered within the fair quotation stature, many parts of them,
especially command definitions, were used as phrase pieces after careful
editorial efforts to fit them into the style and the objective of this
document.
<p>
Most of the contents of <ref id="system"> originally came from 
 "The Debian FAQ" (March 2002):
<list compact>
<item>5. The Debian FTP archives: <file>ftparchives.sgml</file> (entire chapter)
<item>6. Basics of the Debian Package Management System: <file>pkg_basics.sgml</file> (entire chapter)
<item>7. The Debian Package Management Tools: <file>pkgtools.sgml</file> (entire chapter)
<item>8. Keeping Your Debian System Up To Date: <file>uptodate.sgml</file> (entire chapter)
<item>9. Debian and the kernel: <file>kernel.sgml</file> (entire chapter)
<item>10. Customizing your installation of Debian GNU/Linux: <file>customizing.sgml</file>  (part of chapter)
</list>
<p>
These sections of "The Debian FAQ" were included in this document after 
major reorganization to reflect changes in the &debian; system.  
Both documents are updated concurrently now.

<p>The original "Debian FAQ" was made and maintained by J. H. M. Dassen
(Ray) and Chuck Stickelman. Authors of the rewritten "Debian FAQ" are
Susan G. Kleinmann and Sven Rudolph. After them, "The Debian FAQ" was 
maintained by Santiago Vila. The current maintainer is Josip Rodin.  

<p>Parts of the information for "The Debian FAQ" came from:
<list compact>
  <item>The Debian-1.1 release announcement, by <url name="Bruce Perens" id="&perensweb;">.
  <item>The Linux FAQ, by <url name="Ian Jackson" id="&ijacksonweb;">.
  <item><url name="Debian Mailing List Archives" id="&lists;">,
  <item>the dpkg programmers' manual and the Debian Policy manual
    (see <ref id="references">)
  <item>many developers, volunteers, and beta testers, and
  <item>the flaky memories of its authors. :-)
</list>
<p>
Some parts of "Tutorial" section were derived from
<list compact>
<item>"Debian Tutorial" by Havoc Pennington, Oliver Elphick, Ole Tetlie,
James Treacy, Craig Sawyer, and Ivan E. Moore II.  (This document was
derived from "Linux User's Guide" by Larry Greenfield.)
<item>"Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and Usage" by John
Goerzen and Ossama Othman.
</list>
<p>
The authors would like to thank all those who helped make this
document possible.

<p>Comments and additions to this document are always welcome. Please
send email to the <url id="&debian-bts;" name="Debian BTS system"> under
the <package>debian-reference</package> package or under the respective
translation packages.  Use of <prgn>reportbug</prgn> makes it easy

<p>
Although I used to live in the USA, I am a non-native English user.  
Any grammatical corrections are welcomed.
<p>
The best feedback is a patch against the SGML version, but a patch against
the text version is also welcomed.
See <ref id="officialdoc"> for the official document site.
<p>
The original SGML files used to create this document are also available
in CVS at:

<sect id="docformat">Document format
       
<p>This document was written using the DebianDoc SGML DTD (rewritten
from LinuxDoc SGML). The DebianDoc SGML system enables us to create files in
a variety of formats from one source, e.g. this document can be viewed
as HTML, plain text, TeX DVI, PostScript, PDF, and GNU info.

<p>Conversion utilities for DebianDoc SGML are available in the Debian
package <package>debiandoc-sgml</package>.

<sect id="maze">The &debian; maze

<p>
The Linux system is a very powerful computing platform for a networked  
computer.  However, learning how to use all its capabilities is not easy. 
Setting up the printer is a good example.
<p>
There is a complete, detailed map called the "SOURCE CODE".  This is very
accurate but very hard to understand.  There are also references called
HOWTO and mini-HOWTO.  They are easier to understand but tend to give too 
much detail and lose the big picture.  I sometimes have a problem finding
the right section in a long HOWTO when I need a few commands to invoke.
<p>
In order to navigate through this maze of Linux system configuration, I started 
writing down simple reminder memos in text file format as my quick reference.
This list of memos grew larger and I learned debiandoc in the meantime.  The
product is this <em>&book-title;</em>.  

<sect id="quotes">The &debian; quotes
<p>
Here are some interesting quotes from the &debian mailing list.
<list>
<item>"This is Unix. It gives you enough rope to hang yourself." &mdash;Miquel van Smoorenburg <email>miquels@cistron.nl</email>
<item>"Unix IS user friendly... It's just selective about who its friends are." &mdash;Tollef Fog Heen <email>tollef@add.no</email>
