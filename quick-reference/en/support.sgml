<chapt id="support">Support for Debian

<p>
The following resources provide help, advice, and support 
for Debian.  Try your best to use self-help resources before 
crying out loud in the mailing lists. :)

<p>Note that you can access a lot of documentation on your system by using a
WWW browser, via the <prgn>dwww</prgn> or <prgn>dhelp</prgn> commands, found
in their respective packages.

<sect id="references">References
<p>
The following references are available for Debian and Linux 
in general.  If their contents conflict with each other, always rely more 
on primary information sources than on secondary ones
such as this document.

<sect id="dict">Finding the meaning of a word 
<p>
Many words used in Debian are cryptic jargon or acronyms.
The following will solve most questions:
<example>
$ dict &lt;put-a-weird-word-here&gt;
</example>

<sect id="bts">The Debian bug tracking system

<p>The &debian; distribution has a <url id="&bugs;" 
name="bug tracking system (BTS)"> which files
details of bugs reported by users and developers. Each bug is given a
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with.

<p>You should check to see whether your bug report has already been filed by
someone else before submitting it. Lists of currently outstanding bugs are
available on the <url id="&bugs;" name="World Wide Web"> and <url
id="&bugs-access;" name="elsewhere">. See also <ref id="bug-check">.
<p>
The method of reporting a bug is described at <url id="&bugs-reporting;"> 

<sect id="lists">Mailing lists
<p>
Read at least "debian-devel-announce" (English, read-only and low-traffic)
to stay current with Debian.
<p>
The mailing lists of most interest to Debian users are "debian-user"
(English, open and high-traffic) and other "debian-user-<var/language/" lists
(for other languages).
<p>
For information on these lists and details of
how to subscribe, see <url id="&lists;">. Please
check the archives for answers to your question prior to posting and
also adhere to standard list etiquette.

<sect id="irc">Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
        
<p>Debian has an IRC channel dedicated to the support and aid of Debian users
located on the Open Projects IRC network, which is dedicated to providing
collaborative information-sharing resources for the Open Source community. To
access the channel point your favorite IRC client at irc.openprojects.net and
join <tt>#debian</tt>.</p>
        
<p>Please follow the channel guidelines, respecting other users
fully. For more information on Open Projects please visit the <url
id="&openprojectshome;" name="website">.</p>

<sect id="searchtools">Search engines

<p>There are many search engines that serve documentation related
to Debian:
<list>
 <item><url id="&search;" name="Debian WWW search site">.
 <item><url id="&google;" name="Google">: include "site:debian.org" 
     as a search term.
 <item><url id="&googlegroups;" name="Google Groups">: a search
     engine for newsgroups.  Include "group:linux.debian.*"
     as a search term.
 <item><url id="&altavista;" name="AltaVista">
</list>

<p>For example, searching on the string "cgi-perl" gives a more detailed
explanation of this package than the brief description field in its
control file. See <ref id="bug-check"> for related advice.

<sect id="websites">Websites
<p>
There are a few popular websites with general support information.
<list>
 <item><url id="&debianplanet;" name="Debian Planet">
 <item><url id="&linuxcom;" name="Linux.com">
 <item><url id="&unix-guide;" name="&unix-guide-title;">
