<chapt id="support">Support for Debian

<p>
One can find following resources to obtain help, advice and support 
for Debian.  One must try his best to use self-help resources before 
crying out loud in mailing list :)

<p>Note that one may access a lot of documentation on your system by using a
WWW browser, through `dwww' or `dhelp' commands, found in respective
packages.

<sect id="references">References
<p>
Following references are available for Debian and Linux (Unix like OS) 
in general.  If their contents conflict each other, always trust more 
on the primary information sources than on the secondary information 
sources such as this document.

<sect id="dict">Find a meaning of a word 
<p>
Many words used in Debian are cryptic jargons.  Also, many acronyms are used.
Following will solve most questions:
<example>
$ dict &lt;put-a-weired-word-here&gt;
</example>

<sect id="bts">Debian bug tracking system

<p>The &debian; distribution has a <url id="&bugs;" 
name="bug tracking system (BTS)"> which files
details of bugs reported by users and developers. Each bug is given a
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with.

<p>You should check if your bug report has already been filed by someone else
before submitting it. Lists of currently outstanding bugs are available on
the <url id="&bugs;" name="World Wide Web"> and <url id="&bugs-access;" 
name="elsewhere">. See also at <ref id="bug-check">.
<p>
Method of reporting bug is described at <url id="&bugs-reporting;"> 

<sect id="lists">Mailing lists
<p>
Read at least debian-devel-announce (English, read-only & low trafic)
to be current with the Debian.
<p>
The mailing lists of most interest to Debian users are the debian-user 
(English, open & high trafic) and other debian-user-<var/language/ lists
(for other languages).
<p>
For information on these lists and details of
how to subscribe see <url id="&lists;">. Please
check the archives for answers to your question prior to posting and
also adhere to standard list etiquette.

<sect id="irc">Internet Relay Chat
        
<p>Debian has an IRC channel dedicated to the support and aid of
Debian users located on the Open Projects IRC network which is
dedicated to providing collaborative information sharing resources
for the Open Source community. To access the channel point your
favourite IRC client at irc.openprojects.net and join #debian.</p>
        
<p>Please follow the channel guidelines, respecting other users
fully. For more information on Open Projects please visit the <url
id="&openprojectshome;" name="website">.</p>

<sect id="searchtools">Search Engines

<p>There are many search engines that serve documentation related
to Debian:
<list>
 <item><url id="&search;" name="Debian WWW search site">.
 <item><url id="&google;" name="Google">: include "site:debian.org" 
     as a serch term.
 <item><url id="&googlegroups;" name="Google Groups">: a search
     engine for newsgroups.  Include "linux.debian.user" 
     as a serch term.
 <item><url id="&altavista;" name="AltaVista">
</list>

<p>For example, searching on the string "cgi-perl" gives a more detailed
explanation of this package than the brief description field in its
control file. See <ref id="bug-check"> for example.

<sect id="websites">Web sites

There are few popular web sites with some general support information.
