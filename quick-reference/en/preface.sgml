<p>
<![%f-ref;[
This <url id="&debian-reference-project;" name="&full-title;">
is intended to provide a broad overview of the &debian; system as a
<strong>post-installation user's guide</strong>.  Its target reader is
someone who is willing to read shell scripts.  I expect the reader to
have gained basic skills in Unix-like systems prior to reading this
document.
<p> 
I made a conscious decision <strong>not</strong> to explain everything
in detail if it can be found in a <strong>manual page</strong>, an
<strong>info page</strong>, or a <strong>HOWTO document</strong>. 
Instead of full explanations, I have tried to give more directly practical
information by providing <strong>exact command sequences</strong> 
in the main text or <strong>example scripts</strong> under 
<url id="&examples;">.
<p>
Much of the information included consists of reminders or
pointers to the authoritative references listed in <ref
id="references">.  This is partly because this document originated as a
"<strong>quick reference</strong>".

<strong>Keep it short and simple</strong> (KISS) is my guiding principle.

If the system is installed with the bare minimum of packages, make sure
to execute the following commands to install some essential packages
and a few key documents: 
<example>
# apt-get install info man-db doc-base dhelp apt apt-utils auto-apt \
                  dpkg less mc ssh nano-tiny elvis-tiny vim sash \
                  kernel-package \

                  gnupg-doc
# apt-get install debian-reference # for Sarge, do this too :)

<sect>Basics of the Debian distributions
<p>
Debian comes in 3 release "flavors": 
<list>
<item>stable:   Good to track on a production server. Boring for the 
 workstation (WS). 
 <![%f-ref;[See <ref id="stable">.]]>
<item>testing:  Good to track on the WS. <![%f-ref;[See <ref id="testing">.]]>
<item>unstable: Never track this blindly.  <![%f-ref;[See <ref id="unstable">.]]>
</list>
Read at least the key mailing list
<tt>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</tt> for updates on the
status of Debian.
<p>
In March 2002, these three release versions corresponded to <tt>potato</tt>
(production quality), <tt>woody</tt> (beta-test, very stable then since
release was imminent), and <tt>sid</tt> (alpha-test).  In August 2002, right
after the <tt>woody</tt> release, these corresponded to <tt>woody</tt>
(production quality), <tt>sarge</tt> (beta-test, it will be a somewhat rough
ride for some time), and <tt>sid</tt> (always alpha-test).  When packages in
<tt>unstable</tt> have no Release Critical (RC) bugs filed against them after
the first week or so, they are automatically promoted to <tt>testing</tt>.

<p>
There are two approaches which enables you to run the latest versions of 
software on a system.  
<list compact>
<item><ref id="apt-install"> (mainly for WS purposes)
<item><ref id="port"> (mainly for server purposes)
</list>

<p>
Tracking <tt>testing</tt> flavor of &debian; has a side effect of
getting very slow security fixes.  So be warned.
<p>
If you mix flavors of &debian;, <tt>testing</tt> into <tt>stable</tt> or
<tt>unstable</tt> into <tt>stable</tt>, you will likely to pull in many
key packages unintentionally from <tt>testing</tt> or <tt>unstable</tt>
which may be buggy.  So be warned.
<p>
Running <tt>testing</tt> or <tt>unstable</tt> flavor of &debian;
involves increased risk to hit serious bugs.  This risk can be managed
by deploying multi-booting scheme with a more stable flavor of &debian;,
or by deploying the nice trick of <prgn>chroot</prgn> with the more
stable one as described in <ref id="chroot">.  The latter will enable
running different flavors of &debian; simultaneously on different
consoles.
<p>
After explaining some fundamentals of the Debian distribution in <ref
id="system">, I will present some basic information to help you live happily
with the latest software, taking advantage of the <tt>testing</tt> and
<tt>unstable</tt> distributions of Debian. The impatient should proceed to
<ref id="survival"> immediately.  Happy upgrading!
