If system is installed with the "Simple" option, make sure to select
"New user documentation" option. Otherwise, run followings:
<example>
# dselect update
# tasksel
... select "New user documentation" option and others
</example>
In addition to this, install few more packages by:
<example>
# apt-get install debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
       packaging-manual doc-debian doc-linux-text info \
       man-db manpages manpages-dev less mc # for potato

# apt-get install debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
       doc-debian doc-linux-text apt-howto info \
       man-db manpages manpages-dev less mc # for woody
</example>

<sect>Basics of the Debian distributions
<p>
Debian comes in 3 release "flavors": 
<list>
<item>stable:   Good to track on a production server. Boring for the 
 workstation (WS). <ref id="stable">
<item>testing:  Good to track on the WS. <ref id="testing">
<item>unstable: Never track this blindly.  <ref id="unstable">
</list>
Read at least key mailing list <tt>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</tt>
for updates on the status of the Debian.

As of March 2002, these correspond to Potato (production quality),
Woody (beta-test, very stable now), and Sid (alpha-test).  When packages
in unstable have no Release Critical (RC) bugs filed against them 
after the first week or so, they are automatically promoted to testing. 
See <ref id="ftparchives">.
<p>
In theory, there are two things you can do get the latest versions of software
running.  
<p>
<ref id="apt-install"> (mainly for WS purposes)
<p>
<ref id="port"> (mainly for server purposes)
<p>
After explaining some fundamentals of Debian distribution in 
<ref id="system">, I will present some basic information here to 
help you live happily with the
latest software, taking advantage of the testing and unstable distributions of
Debian. The impatient should proceed to <ref id="survival"> immediately.
Happy upgrading!
