<p>
This <url id="&debian-reference-project;" name="&book-title;">
intends to provide a broad overview of &debian; system
as a post-installation user's guide.  Target reader is someone who is
willing to read shell scripts.  I expect the reader to gain basic skills in
unix-like system prior to reading this document.
<p>
I made a conscious decision not to explain everything in details if it can
be found in a <strong>manual page</strong>, an <strong>info
page</strong>, or <strong>HOWTO document</strong>. Also I tried not to
explain but to provide more direct information by
<em>exact command sequences</em> or <em>example scripts</em>.  Many
information included are a reminder or a pointer to the authoritative
references listed in <ref id="references">.  This is partly because this
document was started as a "quick reference".
<p>
<em>Keep it short and simple</em> (KISS) is my guiding principle.
<p>
For help with emergency system maintenance, proceed
to <ref id="survival"> immediately.

<sect id="basic">Basic setup
<p>
If the system is installed with bare minimum packages, make sure to execute
following commands to install a minimum set of packages: 
<example>
# apt-get install debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
doc-debian doc-linux-text apt-howto harden-doc \
info man-db manpages manpages-dev \
less mc nano-tiny elvis-tiny auto-apt
# apt-get install debian-reference # for sarge, do this too :)
</example>

<sect>Basics of the Debian distributions
<p>
Debian comes in 3 release "flavors": 
<list>
<item>stable:   Good to track on a production server. Boring for the 
 workstation (WS). See <ref id="stable">.
<item>testing:  Good to track on the WS. See <ref id="testing">.
<item>unstable: Never track this blindly.  See <ref id="unstable">.
</list>
Read at least the key mailing list
<tt>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</tt> for updates on the
status of Debian.
<p>
In March 2002, these corresponded to <tt>potato</tt> (production
quality), <tt>woody</tt> (beta-test, very stable then since release was
imminent), and <tt>sid</tt> (alpha-test).  Now in August 2002, right
after the <tt>woody</tt> release, these correspond to <tt>woody</tt>
(production quality), <tt>sarge</tt> (beta-test, it will be a somewhat
rough ride for some time), and <tt>sid</tt> (always alpha-test).  When
packages in <tt>unstable</tt> have no Release Critical (RC) bugs filed
against them after the first week or so, they are automatically promoted
to <tt>testing</tt>.  See <ref id="ftparchives">.
<p>
In theory, there are two things you can do get the latest versions of software
running.  
<list>
<item><ref id="apt-install"> (mainly for WS purposes)
<item><ref id="port"> (mainly for server purposes)
</list>
After explaining some fundamentals of the Debian distribution in <ref
id="system">, I will present some basic information to help you live happily
with the latest software, taking advantage of the <tt>testing</tt> and
<tt>unstable</tt> distributions of Debian. The impatient should proceed to
<ref id="survival"> immediately.  Happy upgrading!
