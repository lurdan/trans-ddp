<![%f-ref;[
This <url id="&debian-reference-project;" name="&full-title;">
is intended to provide a broad overview of the &debian; system as a
post-installation user's guide.  Its target reader is
someone who is willing to read shell scripts.  I expect the reader to
have gained basic skills in Unix-like systems prior to reading this
document.
<p> 
I made a conscious decision <strong>not</strong> to explain everything
in detail if it can be found on a manual page, an
info page, or in a HOWTO document. 
Instead of full explanations, I have tried to give more directly practical
information by providing exact command sequences
in the main text or example scripts under <url id="&examples;">.
You must understand the content
of examples before issuing commands.  Your system may require slightly 
different command sequences.
<p>
Much of the information included consists of reminders or
pointers to the authoritative references listed in
<ref id="references">.

This document originated as a "quick reference" but it grew.
Nevertheless,
<strong>Keep It Short and Simple</strong>
(KISS)
is my guiding principle.

If the system is installed with the bare minimum of packages
and you want to make the best use of this document
then it is advisable execute the following commands
in order to install other packages containing useful documents: 
<example>
# apt-get install info man-db doc-base dhelp apt apt-utils auto-apt \
                  dpkg less mc ssh nano-tiny elvis-tiny vim sash \
                  kernel-package \
                  manpages manpages-dev doc-debian doc-linux-text \
                  debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
                  apt-howto harden-doc install-doc \
                  libpam-doc glibc-doc samba-doc exim-doc cvsbook \
                  gnupg-doc
# apt-get install debian-reference # for Sarge, do this too :)
</example>
For Woody, add <package>exim-doc-html</package> to the above list.
For Sarge, replace <package>exim-doc</package> with
<package>exim4-doc-html</package> and <package>exim4-doc-info</package>.

<sect>Basics of the Debian distributions
<p>
Debian maintains three different distributions simultaneously.
These are:
<list>
<item><tt>stable</tt>: &mdash; Most useful for a production server since it is only updated with security fixes.
<![%f-ref;[See <ref id="stable">.]]>
<item><tt>testing</tt> &mdash; The preferred distribution for a workstation since it contains recent releases of desktop software which have received a bit of testing.
<![%f-ref;[See <ref id="testing">.]]>
<item><tt>unstable</tt> &mdash; Cutting edge. The choice of &debian; developers.
<![%f-ref;[See <ref id="unstable">.]]>
</list>
When packages in <tt>unstable</tt> have no release-critical (RC) bugs filed against them after the first week or so, they are automatically promoted to <tt>testing</tt>.  
<p>
<![%f-ref;[
&debian; distributions also have code names as described in
<ref id="codenames">.
]]>
<![%q-ref;[
&debian; distributions also have code names.
]]>
Before Woody was released in August 2002,
the three distributions were, respectively,
Potato, Woody, and Sid.
After Woody was released the three distributions were, respectively,
Woody, Sarge, and Sid.
When Sarge is released, the
<tt>stable</tt> and <tt>unstable</tt>
distributions will be
Sarge and Sid;
a new <tt>testing</tt> distribution will then be created
(initially as a copy of <tt>stable</tt>)
and given a new code name.
<p>
Subscribe to the low-volume mailing list
<tt>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</tt> for 
important announcements about &debian;.
<![%f-ref;[
See <ref id="ftparchives">.
]]>
<p>
If you want to use versions of packages
that are more current than the versions
that were released with the distribution you are using,
then you can either upgrade to a later distribution
as described in <ref id="woody">,
or you can upgrade only selected packages.
If the package can't be upgraded easily then you may
want to backport it as described in
<ref id="port">.
<![%f-ref;[
<p>
Tracking the <tt>testing</tt> distribution
can have the side effect of delaying the installation
of packages containing security fixes.
Such packages are uploaded to <tt>unstable</tt> and
migrate to <tt>testing</tt> only after a delay.
<p>
If you mix distributions, e.g.,
<tt>testing</tt> with <tt>stable</tt> or
<tt>unstable</tt> with <tt>stable</tt>,
you will eventually pull in core packages
such as <package>libc6</package> from
<tt>testing</tt> or <tt>unstable</tt> and there
is no guarantee that these will not contain bugs.
You have been warned.
<p>
Running the <tt>testing</tt> or <tt>unstable</tt> distribution
increases your risk of hitting serious bugs.  This risk can be managed
by deploying a multibooting scheme with a more stable &debian; distribution
or by deploying the nice trick of using <prgn>chroot</prgn> 
as described in <ref id="chroot">.  The latter will enable
running different &debian; distributions simultaneously on different
consoles.
<p>
After an explanation of the fundamentals of the Debian distribution in
<ref id="system">,
you will be given some basic information to help you live happily
with the latest software, taking advantage of the <tt>testing</tt> and
<tt>unstable</tt> distributions of Debian. The impatient should proceed
immediately to <ref id="survival">.  Happy upgrading!
