# command in root account
$ command in user account
... description of action

For Bash, read <prgn>man bash</prgn> and the LDP
<url id="&bashprogintro-howto;" name="BASH Programming - Introduction HOWTO">
as starter information.
<p>
The following abbreviations are used:
<list>
<item>LDP: Linux Documentation Project <url id="&linuxdoc;">
<item>DDP: Debian Documentation Project <url id="&debiandoc;">

<sect id="basic">Basic setup
<p>
If the system is installed with the "Simple" option, make sure to select
the "New user documentation" option. Otherwise, run the following:
<example>
# dselect update
# tasksel
... select "New user documentation" option and others
</example>
In addition to this, install a few more packages by:
<example>
# apt-get install debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
       packaging-manual doc-debian doc-linux-text info \
       man-db manpages manpages-dev less mc # for potato

# apt-get install debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
       doc-debian doc-linux-text apt-howto info \
       man-db manpages manpages-dev less mc # for woody
</example>

<sect>Basics of the Debian distributions
<p>
Debian comes in 3 release "flavors": 
<list>
<item>stable:   Good to track on a production server. Boring for the 
 workstation (WS). See <ref id="stable">.
<item>testing:  Good to track on the WS. See <ref id="testing">.
<item>unstable: Never track this blindly.  See <ref id="unstable">.
</list>
Read at least the key mailing list <tt>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</tt>
for updates on the status of Debian.

As of March 2002, these correspond to <tt>potato</tt> (production quality),
<tt>woody</tt> (beta-test, very stable now), and <tt>sid</tt> (alpha-test).
When packages in <tt>unstable</tt> have no Release Critical (RC) bugs filed
against them after the first week or so, they are automatically promoted to
<tt>testing</tt>.  See <ref id="ftparchives">.
<p>
In theory, there are two things you can do get the latest versions of software
running.  
<p>
<ref id="apt-install"> (mainly for WS purposes)
<p>
<ref id="port"> (mainly for server purposes)
<p>
After explaining some fundamentals of the Debian distribution in <ref
id="system">, I will present some basic information to help you live happily
with the latest software, taking advantage of the <tt>testing</tt> and
<tt>unstable</tt> distributions of Debian. The impatient should proceed to
<ref id="survival"> immediately.  Happy upgrading!
