<chapt id="tune"> Tuning a &debian; system
<p>
This chapter describes only the basics of system configuration. A prerequisite
of this chapter is reading <ref id="install">.  
<p>
For the security concious, 
it is highly recommended to read the <url id="&securing-debian-howto;" 
name="Securing Debian Manual">, which can also be found as the
<package>&p-securing-debian-howto;</package> package.

<sect id="init-hints">System initialization hints
<p>
See <ref id="init"> for the basics of the &debian; init script.

<sect1 id="init-defaults">Customizing init scripts
<p>
&debian; uses the sys-V init script system.  Although all init scripts 
in <file>/etc/init.d/*</file> are marked as conffiles and sysadmins 
are free to modify them, customizing init scripts by
editing files in <file>/etc/defaults/*</file> is the preferred approach.
<p>
For example, <file>/etc/init.d/rcS</file> can be used to customize
boot-time defaults for <prgn>motd</prgn>, <prgn>sulogin</prgn>, etc.

<sect1 id="syslogd">Customizing system logging
<p>
System log mode can be configured using <file>/etc/syslog.conf</file>.
Check the <package>colorize</package> package for a program to 
colorize system log files.
See also <manref name="syslogd" section="8"> and 
<manref name="syslog.conf" section="5">.
</sect1>

<sect1 id="hdtune">Hardware access optimization
<p>
There are a few hardware optimization configurations that &debian; leaves 
to the sysadmin to take care of.
<list>
<item><package>hdparm</package>
 <list compact>
<item>Hard disk access optimization. Very effective.
<item>Dangerous. You must read <manref name="hdparm" section="8"> first.
<item><tt>hdparm -tT <var>/dev/hda</var></tt> to test disk access speed.
<item><tt>hdparm -c1 -d1 -u1 -m16 -A <var>/dev/hda</var></tt> to speed up a
  modern IDE system. (It may be dangerous.)

<sect>Access control

<sect1 id="loginctrl">Access control through PAM and login
<p>
PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) provides login control.  
<example>
/etc/pam.d/*             # PAM control files
/etc/pam.d/login         # PAM control file for login
/etc/security/*          # PAM module parameters
/etc/securetty           # this controls root login by console (login)
/etc/login.defs          # this controls login behaviors (login)
</example>
<p>
Change the contents of <file>/etc/pam.d/login</file> as follows, if you want
insecure but passwordless console terminals at your own risk.
<example>
#auth       required   pam_unix.so nullok
auth       required   pam_permit.so
</example>
Similar tricks can be applied for <prgn>xdm</prgn>, <prgn>gdm</prgn>, ... , 
for passwordless console X.
<p>
The maximum number of processes can be set with 
<tt>ulimit -u 1000</tt> in a Bash shell or with settings in 
<file>/etc/security/limits.conf</file> from PAM.  Other parameters such as
<tt>core</tt> can be set similarly. The initial value of <prgn>PATH</prgn> 
can be set by <file>/etc/login.defs</file> before the shell start up 
script.
<p>
The documentation for PAM is packaged in the
<package>libpam-doc</package> package. The Linux-PAM System
Administrator's Guide covers configuring PAM, what modules are
available etc. The documentation also includes The Linux-PAM
Application Developers' Guide and The Linux-PAM Module Writers'
Guide.
</sect1>

<sect1 id="wheel">"Why GNU <prgn>su</prgn> does not support the <tt>wheel</tt>
group"
<p>
This is the famous phrase at the bottom of the old <tt>info su</tt> page by
Richard M.  Stallman. Not to worry: the current <prgn>su</prgn> in &debian;
uses PAM, so that one can restrict the ability to use <prgn>su</prgn> to any
group using <prgn>pam_wheel.so</prgn> in <file>/etc/pam.d/su</file>.  The
following will set the <tt>adm</tt> group in a &debian; system as an
equivalent of the BSD <tt>wheel</tt> group and allow <prgn>su</prgn> without a
password for its members.
<example>
# anti-RMS configuration in /etc/pam.d/su
auth       required   pam_wheel.so group=adm

# Wheel members to be able to su without a password
auth       sufficient pam_wheel.so trust group=adm
</example>

<sect1>Meaning of various groups
<p>
A few interesting groups:
<list compact>
<item><tt>root</tt> group is the default wheel group for <prgn>su</prgn> 
 if <prgn>pam_wheel.so</prgn> is used without the <tt>group=</tt> argument. 
<item><tt>adm</tt> group can read logfiles. 
<item><tt>cdrom</tt> group can be used locally to give a set of 
        users access to a CD-ROM drive.
<item><tt>floppy</tt> group can be used locally to give a set of 
        users access to a floppy drive.
<item><tt>audio</tt> group can be used locally to give a set of 
        users access to an audio device.
<item><tt>src</tt> group owns source code, including files in 
        <file>/usr/src</file>. It can be used locally to give a user
	the ability to manage system source code.
<item><tt>staff</tt> membership is useful for helpdesk types or junior
	sysadmins, giving them the ability to do things in 
        <file>/usr/local</file> and to create directories in
        <file>/home</file>.

<sect1 id="sudo"><prgn>sudo</prgn> &ndash; a safer work environment
<p>
My usage of <prgn>sudo</prgn> is mostly a protection from my own stupidity.  I consider
using <prgn>sudo</prgn> a better alternative to always using the system as root.
YMMV. 
<p>
Install <prgn>sudo</prgn> and activate it by setting options in
/etc/<url id="&examples;" name="sudoers">.  Also check out the
<tt>sudo</tt> group feature in <file>&dochome;sudo/OPTIONS</file>.
<p>
The sample configuration provides "staff" group members access to any
commands run as root under <prgn>sudo</prgn> and also gives "src" members access to
selected commands run as root under <prgn>sudo</prgn>.
<p>
The advantage of <prgn>sudo</prgn> is that it only requires an ordinary user's password to
log in, and activity is monitored.  This is a nice way to give some authority to
a junior administrator.  For example:
<example>
$ sudo chown -R <var>myself</var>:<var>mygrp</var> .
</example>
<p>
Of course if you know the root password (as most home users do),
any command can be run under root from a user account:
<example>
$ su -c "shutdown -h now"
Password:
</example>
(I know I should tighten the admin account's <prgn>sudo</prgn> privileges.
But since this is my home server, I have not bothered yet.)
<p>
For a different program that allows ordinary users to run commands with root
privileges, see the <package>super</package> package.
</sect1>
    
<sect1 id="tcpd">Access control to daemon programs
<p>
The Internet <em>super-server</em>, <prgn>inetd</prgn>, is started at boot 
time by <file>/etc/rc2.d/S20inetd</file> (for RUNLEVEL=2), which is a
symlink to <file>/etc/init.d/inetd</file>.
Essentially, <prgn>inetd</prgn> allows running one daemon to invoke 
several others, reducing load on the system.
<p>
Whenever a request for service arrives, its protocol and service are
identified by looking them up in the databases in <file>/etc/protocols</file> and 
<file>/etc/services</file>.  <prgn>inetd</prgn> then looks up a normal
Internet service in the <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file> database,  or a Sun-RPC
based service in <file>/etc/rpc.conf</file>.
<p>
For system security, make sure to disable unused services in 
<file>/etc/inetd.conf</file>.
Sun-RPC services need to be active for NFS and other RPC-based programs.
<p>
Sometimes, <prgn>inetd</prgn> does not start the intended server 
directly but starts the <prgn>tcpd</prgn> TCP/IP daemon wrapper program
with the intended server name as its argument in <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file>.  
In this case, <prgn>tcpd</prgn> runs the appropriate server program 
after logging the request and doing some additional checks
using <file>/etc/hosts.deny</file> and <file>/etc/hosts.allow</file>.
<p>
If you have problem with remote access in a recent &debian; system, 
comment out "ALL: PARANOID" in <file>/etc/hosts.deny</file> if it exists.
<p>

<sect id="cdrw">CD-writer
<p>
CD-writers with ATAPI/IDE interfaces have recently become a very popular
option.  It is a nice medium for system backup and archiving for the home user
needing &lt; 640 MB capacity.  For the most authoritative information, see the
LDP <url id="&cd-writing-howto;" name="CD-Writing-HOWTO">.

<sect1>Introduction
<p>
First, any disruption of data sent to the CD-writer will cause irrecoverable
damage to the CD. Get a CD-writer with as large a buffer as possible. If money
is no object, do not bother with ATAPI/IDE, just get a SCSI version.  If you
have a choice of IDE interface to be connected, use the one on the PCI-bus
(i.e., on the motherboard) rather than one on the ISA-bus (an SB16 card,
etc.).
<p>
When a CD-writer is connected to IDE, it has to be driven by the IDE-SCSI
driver instead of an ordinary IDE CD driver. Also, the SCSI generic driver
needs to be activated. There are two possible approaches to doing this,
assuming a kernel distributed with modern distributions (as of March 2001).
</sect1>

<sect1>Approach 1: modules + <prgn>lilo</prgn>
<p>
Add the following line to <file>/etc/lilo.conf</file> if you are using a stock Debian
kernel. If multiple options are used, list them separated by spaces:
<example>
append="hdx=ide-scsi ignore=hdx"
</example>
Here the location of the CD-writer, which is accessed through the ide-scsi driver,
is indicated by <tt>hdx</tt>, where <em>x</em> represents one of the following:
<example>
hdb          for a slave on the first IDE port
hdc          for a master on the second IDE port
hdd          for a slave on the second IDE port
hde ... hdh  for a drive on an external IDE port
</example>
Type the following commands as root to activate after finishing all the
configuration:
<example>
# lilo
# shutdown -h now
</example>
</sect1>


<sect1>Approach 2: recompile the kernel
<p>
Debian uses <prgn>make-kpkg</prgn> to create a kernel.  Use the new
<tt>--append_to_version</tt> with make-kpkg to build multiple kernel images.
See <ref id="kernel">.
<p>
Use the following setup through <tt>make menuconfig</tt>:
<list>
<item>bzImage
<item>Exclude the IDE CD driver (not a must, but simpler to do this)
<item>Compile in ide-scsi and sg, or make them modules
</list>
</sect1>

<sect1>Post-configuration steps
<p>
Kernel support for the CD-writer can be activated during booting by
the following:
<example>
# echo ide-scsi &gt;&gt;/etc/modules
# echo sg       &gt;&gt;/etc/modules
# cd /dev; ln -sf scd0 cdrom
</example>
Manual activation can be done by:
<example>
# modprobe ide-scsi
# modprobe sg
</example>
After reboot, you can check installation by:
<example>
$ dmesg|less
# apt-get install cdrecord
# cdrecord -scanbus
</example>
<p>
[Per Warren Dodge] Sometimes there may be conflicts between
<tt>ide-scsi</tt> and <tt>ide-cd</tt> if there are both CD-ROM and
CD-R/RW on the system.  Try adding the following line to your
<file>/etc/modutils/aliases</file>, running <prgn>update-modules</prgn>, and
rebooting.
<example>
pre-install      ide-scsi      modprobe ide-cd
</example>
This causes the IDE driver to load before <tt>ide-scsi</tt>. The IDE
driver <tt>ide-cd</tt> takes control of the ATAPI CD-ROM &mdash;
anything that it hasn't been told to <strong>ignore</strong>. That
leaves just the ignored devices for <tt>ide-scsi</tt> to control. 
</sect1>

<sect1>CD-image file (bootable)
<p>
To create a CD-ROM of files under <file>target-directory/</file> as
<file>cd-image.raw</file>
(bootable, Joliet TRANS.TBL-enabled format; if not bootable, take out
<tt>-b</tt> and <tt>-c</tt> options), insert a boot floppy in the first floppy drive and
<example>
# dd if=<var>/dev/fd0</var> <var>target-directory/boot.img</var> 
# mkisofs -r -V <var>volume_id</var> -b <var>boot.img</var> -c <var>bootcatalog</var> -J -T \
        -o <var>cd-image.raw</var> <var>target_directory/</var>
</example>
<p>
One funny hack is to make a bootable DOS CD-ROM.  If an ordinary DOS boot
floppy disk image is in the above <file><var>boot.img</var></file>, the CD-ROM will boot
as if a DOS floppy were in the first floppy drive (A:).  Doing this with
freeDOS may be more interesting.
<p>
This CD-image file can be inspected by mounting it on the loop device.
<example>
# mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop <var>cd-image.raw</var> /cdrom
# cd /cdrom
# mc
# umount /cdrom
</example>
</sect1>

<sect1>Write to the CD-writer (R, R/W):
<p>
First test with (assuming double speed)
<example>
# nice --10 cdrecord -dummy speed=2 dev=0,0 <var>disk.img</var>
</example>
Then if OK, write to CD-R with
<example>
# nice --10 cdrecord -v -eject speed=2 dev=0,0 <var>disk.img</var>
</example>
Or write to a CD-RW disk with
<example>
# nice --10 cdrecord -v -eject blank=fast speed=2 dev=0,0 <var>disk.img</var>
</example>
Some CD-RW drives work better with
<example>
# nice --10 cdrecord -v blank=all speed=2 dev=0,0
</example>
followed by
<example>
# nice --10 cdrecord -v -eject speed=2 dev=0,0 <var>disk.img</var>
</example>
Two steps are needed to prevent SCSI timeouts during blanking from
interfering with the burning step.  The argument value to 
<prgn>nice</prgn> may require some adjustments.
</sect1>

<sect1>Make an image file of a CD
<p>
Some CD-Rs and commercial CDs have junk sectors at the end that make copying
by <prgn>dd</prgn> impossible (the Windows 98 CD is one of them).  The
<package>cdrecord</package> package comes with the <prgn>readcd</prgn> command.  Use this to copy
any CD contents to an image file.  If it is a data disk, mount it and run
<prgn>mount</prgn> to see its actual size.  Divide the number shown (in blocks, = 1024
bytes) by 2 to get the number of actual CD sectors (2048 bytes).  Run
<prgn>readcd</prgn> with options and use this disk image to burn the CD-R/RW.
<example>
# readcd <var>target</var> <var>lun</var> <var>scsibusno</var> # select function 11
</example> 
Here, set all 3 command-line parameters to 0 for most cases.  Sometimes the
number of sectors given by <prgn>readcd</prgn> is excessive!  Use the above
number from an actual mount for better results.
<example>
My CD-R       = +2 sectors
MS Windows CD = +1 sector, i.e., +2048 bytes
</example>
</sect1>

<sect1>Debian CD images
<p>
To obtain the latest information on &debian; CDs, visit the
<url id="&debian-cd;" name="Debian CD site">. 
<p>
If you have a fast Internet connection, think about installing over 
the network using:
<list compact>
<item>a few <url id="&debian-floppyinst;" name="floppy images">.
<item>a <url id="&debian-netinst;" name="minimal bootable CD image">.
</list>
<p>
If you do not have a fast Internet connection, think about purchasing 
CDs from a <url id="&debian-venders;" name="CD vendors">.
<p>
Please do not waste bandwidth by downloading standard CD images 
unless you are a CD image tester (even with the new jigdo method).
<p>
One noteworthy CD image is <url id="&knoppix;" 
name="KNOPPIX - Live Linux Filesystem On CD">.  
This CD will boot a functioning &debian; system without 
installing itself to the hard disk.

The default <tt><var>displayname</var></tt> for the X client program (application side) 
can be set by the DISPLAY environment variable.  For example, prior to 
running an X client program, executing one of the following commands 
achieves this:

Because a remote TCP/IP socket connection without encryption is prone 
to an eavesdropping attack, the default setting for X in recent 
&debian; versions disables the TCP/IP socket.  Consider using <prgn>ssh</prgn> 
for a remote X connection (see <ref id="xssh">). 
<p>
The method described here is not encouraged unless one is in a very secure 
environment behind a good firewall system with only trusted users present.
Use the following command to verify your current X server setting for the
TCP/IP socket:
<example>
# find /etc/X11 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep nolisten
/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc:exec /usr/bin/X11/X -dpi 100 -nolisten tcp
</example>
Remove <tt>-nolisten</tt> to restore TCP/IP listening on the X server.
</sect1>
 
<sect1 id="xhost">Remote X connection: <prgn>xhost</prgn>
<p>
<prgn>xhost</prgn> allows access based on hostnames. This is very insecure.
The following will disable host checking and allow connections from anywhere 
if a TCP/IP socket connection is allowed (see <ref id="xtcp">):
<example>
$ xhost +
</example>
You can re-enable host checking with:
<example>
$ xhost -
</example>
<p>
<prgn>xhost</prgn> does not distinguish between different users on the 
remote host. Also, hostnames (addresses actually) can be spoofed. 
<p>
This method must be avoided even with more restrictive host criteria
if you're on an untrusted network (for instance with dialup PPP
access to the Internet).  See <manref name="xhost" section="1x">.
</sect1>

<sect1 id="xssh">Remote X connection: <prgn>ssh</prgn>
<p>
The use of <prgn>ssh</prgn> enables a secure connection from a local X server 
to a remote application server.  
<list>
<item>Set <tt>X11Forwarding</tt> and <tt>AllowTcpForwarding</tt> entries 
to <tt>yes</tt> in <file>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</file> of the remote host.
<item>Start the X server on the local host.
<item>Open an <prgn>xterm</prgn> in the local host.
<item>Run <prgn>ssh</prgn> to establish a connection with the remote site.  
<example>
localname @ localhost $ ssh -q -X -l loginname remotehost.domain
Password:
.....
</example>
<item>Run X application commands on the remote site.
<example>
loginname @ remotehost $ gimp &
</example>
</list>
This method allows the display of the remote X client output as if it 
were locally connected through a local UNIX domain socket.

<sect1 id="ss-xsu">Gain root in X
<p>
If a GUI program needs to be run with root privilege, use the following
procedures to display program output on a user's X server. 
Never attempt to start an X
server directly from the root account in order to prevent possible
security risks.
<p>
Start the X server as a normal user and open an <prgn>xterm</prgn> console.
Then:
<example>
$ XAUTHORITY=$HOME/.Xauthority
$ export XAUTHORITY
$ su root
Password:*****
# printtool &
</example>
When using this trick to <prgn>su</prgn> to a non-root user, make
sure <file>$HOME/.Xauthority</file> is group readable by this non-root user.
<p>
This command sequence can be automated by adding a few files.  From the root
account, create the file
<file>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/00xfree86-common_environment</file>, containing
the following lines:
<example>
if [ -f "$HOME/.xenvironment" ]; then
    . $HOME/.xenvironment
fi
</example>
From the user account, create the file <file>$HOME/.xenvironment</file> in
the user's home directory, containing following lines:
<example>
# This makes X work when I su to the root account.
if [ -z "$XAUTHORITY" ]; then
        XAUTHORITY=$HOME/.Xauthority
        export XAUTHORITY
fi
</example>
Then run <prgn>su</prgn> (not <tt>su -</tt>) in an
<prgn>xterm</prgn> window of the user.  Now GUI programs started from this
<prgn>xterm</prgn> can display output on this user's X window while running
with root privilege.  This trick works as long as the default Xsession is
executed.  If a user set up his customization using <file>$HOME/.xinit</file>
or <file>$HOME/.xsession</file>, the abovementioned environment
<tt>XAUTHORITY</tt> variable needs to be set similaly in those scripts.

<p>Alternatively, <package>sudo</package> can be used to automate the command sequence:
<example>
$ sudo xterm
... or
$ sudo -H -s
</example>
Here <file>/root/.bashrc</file> should contain:
<example>
if [ $SUDO_USER ]; then
    sudo -H -u $SUDO_USER xauth extract - $DISPLAY | xauth merge -
fi
</example>
This works fine even with the home directory of the user on an NFS
mount, because root does not read the <file>.Xauthority</file> file.
<p>
There are also several specialized packages for this purpose:
<package>kdesu</package>, <package>gksu</package>, <package>gksudo</package>,
<package>gnome-sudo</package>, and <package>xsu</package>.  Some
other methods can be used to achieve similar results: creating a symlink from
<file>/root/.Xauthority</file> to the user's corresponding one; use of the
script <url id="&suxhome;" name="&quot;sux&quot;">; or putting "<tt>xauth merge
~<var>USER_RUNNING_X</var>/.Xauthority</tt>" in the root initialization script.

<sect1 id="xfs-tt">TrueType fonts in X
<p>
The standard <prgn>xfs</prgn> in XFree86-4 works fine with TrueType
fonts.  You have to install a third-party font server such as
<prgn>xfs-xtt</prgn>, if you are using XFree86-3.
<p>
You just need to make sure that whatever apps you want to use the
TrueType fonts are linked against libXft or libfreetype (you probably
don't even have to worry about this if you're using precompiled
.debs).
<p>
Remember to install required font files and generate the 
<file>fonts.{scale,dir}</file> files so that the fonts can be indexed
and used.
<p>
Since <strong>Free</strong> fonts are sometimes limited, installing
or sharing some commercial TrueType fonts is an option for a &debian;
users. In order to make this process easy for the user, 
some convienience packages have been created:
<list compact>
<item><package>ttf-commercial</package>
<item><package>msttcorefonts</package> (No longer useful as of 8/2002 
 due to M$ policy change)
</list>
You'll have a really good selection of TT fonts at the expense of
contaminating your <strong>Free</strong> system with non-Free fonts.

<sect1 id="ss-browser">Web Browser (graphical)

<file>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</file> of the remote host.
</sect1>

<sect1 id="ssh-rsa">Connect with fewer passwords
<p>
One can avoid having to remember a password for each remote system by using
RSAAuthentication (SSH1 protocol) or PubkeyAuthentication (SSH2 protocol).  
<p>
On the remote system, set respective entries,
"RSAAuthentication yes" or "PubkeyAuthentication yes", in 
<file>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</file>.
<p>
Then generate authentication keys locally and install the public key
on the remote system:
<example>
$ ssh-keygen          # RSAAuthentication: RSA1 key for SSH1
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user1@remote \
        "cat - &gt;&gt;.ssh/authorized_keys"
...
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa   # PubkeyAuthentication: RSA key for SSH2
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user1@remote \
        "cat - &gt;&gt;.ssh/authorized_keys"
...
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa   # PubkeyAuthentication: DSA key for SSH2
$ cat .ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh user1@remote \
        "cat - &gt;&gt;.ssh/authorized_keys"
</example>
One can change the passphrase later with "<tt>ssh-keygen -p</tt>".
Make sure to verify settings by testing the connection.  In case of any
problem, use "<tt>ssh -v</tt>".
<p>
You can add options to the entries in <prgn>authorized_keys</prgn> to limit
hosts and to run specific commands. See <manref name="sshd" section="8"> for details.
<p>
Note that SSH2 has <tt>HostbasedAuthentication</tt>. For this to work, 
you must adjust settings of <tt>HostbasedAuthentication</tt> to <tt>yes</tt> in 
both <file>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</file> on the server machine and 
<file>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</file> or <file>$HOME/.ssh/config</file> on 
the client machine.

<p>
Use <prgn>exim</prgn> as the mail transfer agent (MTA). Configure:
<example>
/etc/exim/exim.conf     "eximconfig" to create and edit
/etc/inetd.conf         comment out smtp to run exim as daemon
/etc/email-addresses    Add spoofed source address lists
check filters using exim -brw, -bf, -bF, -bV, ... etc.
</example>

<sect2>A catchall for nonexistent email addresses (Exim)
<p>
In <file>/etc/exim/exim.conf</file> (Woody or later),
in the DIRECTORS part, at the end (after the localuser: director)
add a catch-all director that matches all addresses that the
previous directors couldn't resolve (per Miquel van Smoorenburg):
<example>
catchall:
  driver = smartuser
    new_address = webmaster@mydomain.com
</example>
<p>
If one wants to have more a detailed recipe for each virtual domain, etc., 
add the following at the end of <file>/etc/exim/exim.conf</file> 
(per me, not well tested):
<example>
*@yourdomain.com ${lookup{$1}lsearch*{/etc/email-addresses} \
        {$value}fail} T

/etc/rc?.d/???fetchmail run update-rc.d fetchmail default priority 30
/etc/fetchmailrc        configuration file (chown 600, owned by fetchmail)
</example>
<p>
Information on how to start fetchmail as a daemon from the <prgn>init.d</prgn>

<sect1>Mail utility (Procmail)
<p>

<sect1>Mail user agent (Mutt)
<p>
Use <prgn>mutt</prgn> as the mail user agent (MUA) in combination with
<prgn>vim</prgn>.

<sect1 id="locales">Locales
<p>
Debian supports <strong>locale</strong> technology.  Locale is a mechanism
that allows programs to provide suitable output and functionality according to
local conventions such as character set, format for date and time, currency
symbol, and so on. It uses environment variables to determine the appropriate
behavior. For example, assuming you have both the American English and French
locales installed on your system, the error messages of many programs can be
bilingual:
<example>
$ LANG="en_US" cat foo
cat: foo: No such file or directory
$ LANG="fr_FR" cat foo
cat: foo: Aucun fichier ou répertoire de ce type
</example>
Glibc offers support for this functionality to programs as a library.  See
<manref name="locale" section="7">.

<list compact>
 <item>Edit <file>/etc/locale.gen</file> to add the desired locale, then
   run <prgn>locale-gen</prgn> as root to compile it. See <manref
   name="locale-gen" section="8"> and the manpages listed in its "SEE ALSO"
   section.
 <item>Run <tt>dpkg-reconfigure locales</tt> to reconfigure the
   <package>locales</package> package. Or if it is not already installed,
   installing <package>locales</package> will invoke the debconf interface to
   let you choose needed locales and compile the database.

<sect1 id="env-locale">Activate a particular locale
<p>
The following environment variables are evaluated in this order to provide
particular locale values to programs:
<enumlist>
<item>LANGUAGE: This environment variable consists of a colon-separated 
      list of locale names in order of priority. Used only if the POSIX
      locale is set to a value other than "C" [in Woody; the Potato version
      always has priority over the POSIX locale]. (GNU extension)
<item>LC_ALL: If this is non-null, the value is used for all locale
      categories. (POSIX.1) Usually "" (null).
<item>LC_*: If this is non-null, the value is used
      for the corresponding category (POSIX.1).  Usually "C".
<p>
      LC_* variables are:
 <list compact>
<item>LC_CTYPE: Character classification and case conversion.
<item>LC_COLLATE: Collation order.
<item>LC_TIME: Date and time formats.
<item>LC_NUMERIC: Non-monetary numeric formats.
<item>LC_MONETARY: Monetary formats.
<item>LC_MESSAGES: Formats of informative and diagnostic messages and
            interactive responses.
<item>LC_PAPER: Paper size.
<item>LC_NAME: Name formats.
<item>LC_ADDRESS: Address formats and location information.
<item>LC_TELEPHONE: Telephone number formats.
<item>LC_MEASUREMENT: Measurement units (Metric or Other).
<item>LC_IDENTIFICATION: Metadata about the locale information.
 </list>
<item>LANG:   If this is non-null and LC_ALL is undefined, the value is used
      for all LC_* locale categories with undefined values. (POSIX.1) Usually
      "C".
</enumlist>
Note that some applications (e.g., Netscape 4) ignore LC_* settings.
<p>
The <prgn>locale</prgn> program can display active locale settings and
available locales; see <manref name="locale" section="1">. (NOTE: <tt>locale
-a</tt> lists all the locales that your system knows about; this does
<em>not</em> mean that all of them are compiled! See
<ref id="activate-locales">.)

<sect1 id="beyond-locale">Beyond <tt>locale</tt>
<p>
Programs may need to be configured beyond <tt>locale</tt> configuration
to enable a comfortable working environment.
<p>
The <package>language-env</package> package and its command 
<prgn>set-language-env</prgn> greatly eases the configuration of the national
language environment on a &debian; system.
<p>
Also, language-specific entries in the "task" system accessed through 
<prgn>tasksel</prgn> or <prgn>aptitude</prgn> are another useful
resource.
<P>

Also see the internationalization document, <url id="&intro-i18n;" 
name="Introduction to i18n">. It is aimed at developers but is also 
useful for system administrators.
