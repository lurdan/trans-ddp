TIP: For general guide to the GNU/Linux networking, read the http://www.tldp.org/LDP/nag2/[Linux Network Administrators Guide].

The traditional http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite[TCP/IP network] setup on Debian system uses `ifupdown` package as a high level tool.  There are 2 typical cases.

- For **dynamic IP** system such as mobile PCs, you should setup TCP/IP network **with** the `resolvconf` package and enable you to switch your network configuration easily (see <<_the_network_interface_served_by_the_dhcp>>).
- For **static IP** system such as servers, you should setup TCP/IP network **without** the `resolvconf` package and keep your system simple (see <<_the_network_interface_with_the_static_ip>>).

We describe these traditional cases in detail here.

We also touch on some alternative high level tools such as `network-manager` and `wicd` which ease configuration of wireless networks (see <<_automatic_network_configuration>>).

=== The basic network infrastructure

Let's review the basic network infrastructure on the modern Debian system.

==== The domain name

The naming for the domain name is a tricky one for the normal PC workstation users.  The PC workstation may be mobile one hopping around the network or located behind the NAT firewall inaccessible from the Internet. For such case, you may not want the domain name to be a valid domain name to avoid name collision.

// When you use your SMTP ISP's domain name, you should use a unique hostname which your ISP does not use to avoid name collision (see <<_the_hostname_resolution>>).

// Any authoritative recommendation is welcomed.

According to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606[rfc2606], "`invalid`" seems to be a choice for the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain[top level domain (TLD)] to construct domain names that are sure to be invalid from the Internet. 

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDNS[mDNS] network discovery protocol (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)[Apple Bonjour / Apple Rendezvous], Avahi on Debian) uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.local["local"] as the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-top-level_domain[pseudo-top-level domain].  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/296250[Microsoft also seems to promote "local" for the TLD of local area network]. 

Other popular choices for the invalid TLD seem to be "`localdomain`", "`lan`", "`localnet`", or "`home`" according to my incoming mail analysis.  

==== The hostname resolution

The hostname resolution is currently supported by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch[NSS (Name Service Switch)] mechanism too.  The flow of this resolution is the following.

1. The "`/etc/nsswitch.conf`" file with stanza like "`hosts: files dns`" dictates the hostname resolution order. (This replaces the old functionality of the "`order`" stanza in "`/etc/host.conf`".)
2. The `files` method is invoked first.  If the hostname is found in the "`/etc/hosts`" file, it returns all valid addresses for it and exits. (The "`/etc/host.conf`" file contains "`multi on`".)
3. The `dns` method is invoked.  If the hostname is found by the query to the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System[Internet Domain Name System (DNS)] identified by the "`/etc/resolv.conf`" file, it returns all valid addresses for it and exits.

The "`/etc/hosts`" file http://bugs.debian.org/316099[associates IP addresses with hostnames] contains the following.

--------------------
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 <host_name>.<domain_name> <host_name>

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
--------------------

Here the <host_name> in this matches the own hostname defined in the "`/etc/hostname`".  The <domain_name> in this is the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN[fully qualified domain name (FQDN)] of this host.

TIP: For the mobile PC without real FQDN, you may pick a TLD such as bogus "`invalid`" or mDNS "`local`" as the TLD part of <domain_name> in this configuration.

The "`/etc/resolv.conf`" is a static file if the `resolvconf` package is not installed.  If installed, it is a symbolic link.  Either way, it contains information that initialize the resolver routines. If the DNS is found at IP="`192.168.11.1`", it contains the following.

--------------------
nameserver 192.168.11.1
--------------------

The `resolvconf` package makes this "`/etc/resolv.conf`" into a symbolic link and manages its contents by the hook scripts automatically.

The hostname resolution via Multicast DNS (using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroconf[Zeroconf], aka http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)[Apple Bonjour / Apple Rendezvous]) which effectively allows name resolution by common Unix/Linux programs in the ad-hoc mDNS domain "`local`", can be provided by installing the `libnss-mdns` package.  The "`/etc/nsswitch.conf`" file should have stanza like "`hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4`" to enable this functionality.

==== The network interface name

The network interface name, e.g. `eth0`, is assigned to each hardware in the Linux kernel through the user space configuration mechanism, `udev` (see <<_the_udev_system>>), as it is found.  The network interface name is referred as **physical interface** in `ifup`(8) and `interfaces`(5).

In order to ensure each network interface to be named persistently for each reboot using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address[MAC address] etc., there is a record file "`/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`".  This file is automatically generated by the "`/lib/udev/write_net_rules`" program, probably run by the "`persistent-net-generator.rules`" rules file. You can modify it to change naming rule.

CAUTION: When editing the "`/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`" rules file, you must keep each rule on a single line and the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address[MAC address] in lowercase. For example, if you find "Firewire device" and "PCI device" in this file, you probably want to name "PCI device" as `eth0` and configure it as the primary network interface.

==== The network address range for the LAN

Let us be reminded of the IPv4 32 bit address ranges in each class reserved for use on the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network[local area networks (LANs)] by http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918[rfc1918].  These addresses are guaranteed not to conflict with any addresses on the Internet proper.  

.List of network address ranges
[grid="all"]
`-----`----------------------------`-------------`--------------`------------
Class network addresses            net mask      net mask /bits # of subnets 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A     10.x.x.x                     255.0.0.0     /8             1            
B     172.16.x.x -- 172.31.x.x     255.255.0.0   /16            16           
C     192.168.0.x -- 192.168.255.x 255.255.255.0 /24            256          
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If one of these addresses is assigned to a host, then that host must not access the Internet directly but must access it through a gateway that acts as a proxy for individual services or else does http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation[Network Address Translation(NAT)].  The broadband router usually performs NAT for the consumer LAN environment.

==== The network configuration infrastructure

There are 2 types of low level networking programs for Linux networking system (see <<_iproute2_commands>>).

- Old http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:Net-tools[net-tools] programs (`ifconfig`(8), ...) are from the Linux NET-3 networking system. Most of these are obsolete now.
- New http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:Iproute2[Linux iproute2] programs (`ip`(8), ...) are the current Linux networking system.

Although these low level networking programs are powerful, they are cumbersome to use.  So high level network configuration systems have been created.

The `ifupdown` package is the de facto standard for such high level network configuration system on Debian.  It enables you to bring up network simply by doing , e.g., "`ifup eth0`".  Its configuration file is the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file and its typical contents are the following.

--------------------
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
--------------------

The `resolvconf` package was created to supplement `ifupdown` system to support smooth reconfiguration of network address resolution by automating rewrite of resolver configuration file "`/etc/resolv.conf`".  Now, most Debian network configuration packages are modified to use `resolvconf` package (see "`/usr/share/doc/resolvconf/README.Debian`").

Helper scripts to the `ifupdown` package such as `ifplugd`, `guessnet`, `ifscheme`, etc. are created to automate dynamic configuration of network environment such as one for mobile PC on wired LAN.  These are relatively difficult to use but play well with existing `ifupdown` system.

Alternative high level network configuration systems, independent of `ifupdown` system, such as `network-manager`, `wicd`, etc. are created to ease configuration of network environment even for mobile PC on wireless network.  Since these are relatively new system and their integration to Debian system is in progress, you may still need to disable the corresponding network interface configuration manually in "`/etc/network/interfaces`" to avoid conflicts between these and `ifupdown` (see <<_automatic_network_configuration>>).

==== The network device support

Although most hardware devices are supported by the Debian system, there are some network devices which require http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines[DSFG] non-free external hardware drivers to support them.  Please see <<_non_free_hardware_drivers>>.

=== The network connection method

CAUTION: The connection test method described in this section are meant for testing purposes.  It is not meant to be used directly for the daily network connection.  You are advised to use them via the `ifupdown` package (see <<_the_basic_network_configuration_with_ifupdown>>).

// FIXME: Since my MacBook has no build-in modem, and I use the broadband-modem via Ethernet, all POTS-related description needs to be tested with the recent system.

The typical network connection method and connection path for a PC can be summarized as the following.

NOTE: The WAN connection services via cable TV are generally served by DHCP or PPPoE.  The ones by ADSL and FTTP are generally served by PPPoE.  You have to consult your ISP for exact configuration requirements of the WAN connection.

NOTE: When BB-router is used to create home LAN environment, PCs on LAN are connected to the WAN via BB-router with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation[network address translation (NAT)].  For such case, PC@@@sq@@@s network interfaces on the LAN are served by static IP or DHCP from the BB-router.  BB-router must be configured to connect the WAN following the instruction by your ISP.

==== The DHCP connection with the Ethernet

The typical modern home and small business network, i.e. LAN, are connected to the WAN(Internet) using some consumer grade broadband router.  The LAN behind this router is usually served by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)] server running on the router.

Just install the `dhcp3-client` package for the Ethernet served by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)].

==== The static IP connection with the Ethernet

No special action is needed for the Ethernet served by the static IP.

==== The PPP connection with pppconfig

The configuration script `pppconfig` configures the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol[PPP] connection interactively just by selecting the following.

- The telephone number
- The ISP user name
- The ISP password
- The port speed
- The modem communication port
- The authentication method

==== The alternative PPP connection with wvdialconf

A different approach to using `pppd`(8) is to run it from `wvdial`(1) which comes in the `wvdial` package.  Instead of `pppd` running `chat`(8) to dial in and negotiate the connection, `wvdial` does the dialing and initial negotiating and then starts `pppd` to do the rest.  

The configuration script `wvdialconf` configures the PPP connection interactively just by selecting the following.

- The telephone number
- The ISP user name
- The ISP password

`wvdial` succeeds in making the connection in most cases and maintains authentication data list automatically.

==== The PPPoE connection with pppoeconf

When your ISP serves you with PPPoE connection and you decide to connect your PC directly to the WAN, the network of your PC must be configured with the PPPoE. The PPPoE stand for PPP over Ethernet. The configuration script `pppoeconf` configures the PPPoE connection interactively.

The configuration files are the following.

=== The basic network configuration with ifupdown

The `ifupdown` package provides the standardized framework for the high level network configuration in the Debian system. In this section, we learn the basic network configuration with `ifupdown` with simplified introduction and many typical examples.

==== The command syntax simplified

The `ifupdown` package contains 2 commands: `ifup`(8) and `ifdown`(8).  They offer high level network configuration dictated by the configuration file "/etc/network/interfaces".

.List of basic network configuration commands with ifupdown
[grid="all"]
`-------------`-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
command       action
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`ifup eth0`   bring up a network interface `eth0` with the configuration `eth0` if "`iface eth0`" stanza exists
`ifdown eth0` bring down a network interface `eth0` with the configuration `eth0` if "`iface eth0`" stanza exists
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Do not use low level configuration tools such as `ifconfig`(8) and `ip`(8) commands to configure an interface in **up** state.

NOTE: There is no command `ifupdown`.

==== The basic syntax of "/etc/network/interfaces"

The key syntax of "`/etc/network/interfaces`" as explained in `interfaces`(5) can be summarized as the following.

[[list-of-stanzas-in-eni]]
.List of stanzas in "`/etc/network/interfaces`"
[grid="all"]
`-----------------------------------------------------`-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stanza                                                meaning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"`auto <interface_name>`"                             start interface  <interface_name> upon start of the system
"`allow-auto <interface_name>`"                       , ,
"`allow-hotplug <interface_name>`"                    start interface <interface_name> when the kernel detects a hotplug event from the interface
Lines started with "`iface <config_name> ...`"        define the network configuration <config_name>
Lines started with "`mapping <interface_name_glob> `" define mapping value of <config_name> for the matching <interface_name>
A line starting with a hash "`#`"                     ignore as comments (end-of-line comments are **not** supported)
A line ending with a backslash "`\`"                  extend the configuration to the next line
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lines started with **`iface`** stanza has the following syntax.

--------------------
iface <config_name> <address_family> <method_name>
 <option1> <value1>
 <option2> <value2>
 ...
--------------------

For the basic configuration, the **`mapping`** stanza is not used and you use the network interface name as the network configuration name (See <<_the_mapping_stanza>>).

WARNING: Do not define duplicates of the "`iface`" stanza for a network interface in "`/etc/network/interfaces`".

==== The loopback network interface

The following configuration entry in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file brings up the loopback network interface `lo` upon booting the system (via **`auto`** stanza).

--------------------
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
--------------------

This one always exists in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file.

==== The network interface served by the DHCP

After prepairing the system by <<_the_dhcp_connection_with_the_ethernet>>, the network interface served by the DHCP is configured by creating the configuration entry in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file as the following.

--------------------
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
 hostname "mymachine"
--------------------

When the Linux kernel detects the physical interface `eth0`, the **`allow-hotplug`** stanza causes `ifup` to bring up the interface and the **`iface`** stanza causes `ifup` to use DHCP to configure the interface.

==== The network interface with the static IP

The network interface served by the static IP is configured by creating the configuration entry in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file as the following.

--------------------
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
 address 192.168.11.100
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 broadcast 192.168.11.255
 gateway 192.168.11.1
 dns-domain lan
 dns-nameservers 192.168.11.1
--------------------

When the Linux kernel detects the physical interface `eth0`, the **`allow-hotplug`** stanza causes `ifup` to bring up the interface and the **`iface`** stanza causes `ifup` to use the static IP to configure the interface.

Here, I assumed the following.

- IP address range of the LAN network: `192.168.11.0` - `192.168.11.255`
- IP address of the gateway: `192.168.11.1`
- IP address of the PC: `192.168.11.100`
- The `resolvconf` package: installed
- The domain name: "`lan`"
- IP address of the DNS server: `192.168.11.1`

When the `resolvconf` package is not installed, DNS related configuration needs to be done manually by editing the "`/etc/resolv.conf`" as the following.

--------------------
nameserver 192.168.11.1 
domain lan
--------------------

CAUTION: The IP addresses used in the above example are not meant to be copied literally.  You have to adjust IP numbers to your actual network configuration.

==== The basics of wireless LAN interface

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN[wireless LAN (WLAN for short)] provides the fast wireless connectivity through the spread-spectrum communication of unlicensed radio bands based on the set of standards called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11[IEEE 802.11].

The WLAN interfaces are almost like normal Ethernet interfaces but require some network ID and encryption key data to be provided when they are initialized.  Their high level network tools are exactly the same as that of Ethernet interfaces except interface names are a bit different like `eth1`, `wlan0`, `ath0`, `wifi0`, ... depending on the kernel drivers used.

TIP: The `wmaster0` device is the master device which is an internal device used only by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftMAC[SoftMAC] with new http://linuxwireless.org/[mac80211 API of Linux].

Here are some keywords to remember for the WLAN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The actual choice of protocol is usually limited by the wireless router you deploy.

==== The wireless LAN interface with WPA/WPA2

You need to install the `wpasupplicant` package to support the WLAN with the new WPA/WPA2.

In case of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP] served IP on WLAN connection, the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file entry should be as the following.

--------------------
allow-hotplug ath0
iface ath0 inet dhcp
 wpa-ssid homezone
 # hexadecimal psk is encoded from a plaintext passphrase
 wpa-psk 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f
--------------------

See "`/usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.modes.gz`".

==== The wireless LAN interface with WEP

You need to install the `wireless-tools` package to support the WLAN with the old WEP.  (Your consumer grade router may still be using this insecure infrastructure but this is better than nothing.)

CAUTION: Please note that your network traffic on WLAN with WEP may be sniffed by others.

In case of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP] served IP on WLAN connection, the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file entry should be as the following.

--------------------
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
 wireless-essid Home
 wireless-key1 0123-4567-89ab-cdef
 wireless-key2 12345678
 wireless-key3 s:password
 wireless-defaultkey 2
 wireless-keymode open
--------------------

See "`/usr/share/doc/wireless-tools/README.Debian`".

==== The PPP connection

You need to configure the PPP connection first as described before (see <<_the_ppp_connection_with_pppconfig>>).  Then, add the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file entry for the primary PPP device `ppp0` as the following.

--------------------
iface ppp0 inet ppp
 provider <isp_name>
--------------------

==== The alternative PPP connection

You need to configure the alternative PPP connection with `wvdial` first as described before (see <<_the_alternative_ppp_connection_with_wvdialconf>>).  Then, add the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file entry for the primary PPP device `ppp0` as the following.

--------------------
iface ppp0 inet wvdial
--------------------

==== The PPPoE connection

For PC connected directly to the WAN served by the PPPoE, you need to configure system with the PPPoE connection as described before (see <<_the_pppoe_connection_with_pppoeconf>>).  Then, add the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file entry for the primary PPPoE device `eth0` as the following.

--------------------
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet manual
 pre-up /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up
 up ifup ppp0=dsl
 down ifdown ppp0=dsl
 post-down /sbin/ifconfig eth0 down
# The following is used internally only
iface dsl inet ppp
 provider dsl-provider
--------------------

==== The network configuration state of ifupdown

The "`/etc/network/run/ifstate`" file stores the **intended** network configuration states for all the currently active network interfaces managed by the `ifupdown` package are listed. Unfortunately, even if the `ifupdown` system fails to bring up the interface as intended, the "`/etc/network/run/ifstate`" file lists it active.

Unless the output of the `ifconfig`(8) command for an interface does not have a line like following example, it can not be used as a part of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4[IPV4 network].

--------------------
  inet addr:192.168.11.2  Bcast:192.168.11.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
--------------------

NOTE: For the Ethernet device connected to the PPPoE, the output of the `ifconfig`(8) command lacks a line which looks like above example.

==== The basic network reconfiguration

When you try to reconfigure the interface, e.g. `eth0`, you must disable it first with the "**`sudo ifdown eth0`**" command.  This removes the entry of `eth0` from the "`/etc/network/run/ifstate`" file. (This may result in some error message if `eth0` is not active or it is configured improperly previously.  So far, it seems to be safe to do this for the simple single user work station at any time.)

You are now free to rewrite the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" contents as needed to reconfigure the network interface, `eth0`.

Then, you can reactivate `eth0` with the "**`sudo ifup eth0`**" command.

TIP: You can (re)initialize the network interface simply by "**`sudo ifdown eth0;sudo ifup eth0`**".

==== The ifupdown-extra package

The `ifupdown-extra` package provides easy network connection tests for use with the `ifupdown` package.

- The `network-test`(1) command can be used from the shell.
- The automatic scripts are run for each `ifup` command execution.

The `network-test` command frees you from the execution of cumbersome low level commands to analyze the network problem.

The automatic scripts are installed in "`/etc/network/\*/`" and performs the following.

- Check the network cable connection
- Check duplicate use of IP address
- Setup system@@@sq@@@s static routes based on the "`/etc/network/routes`" definition
- Check if network gateway is reachable
- Record results in the "`/var/log/syslog`" file

This syslog record is quite useful for administration of the network problem on the remote system.

TIP: The automatic behavior of the `ifupdown-extra` package is configurable with the "`/etc/default/network-test`". Some of these automatic checks slow down the system boot-up a little bit since it takes some time to listen for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol[ARP] replies.

=== The advanced network configuration with ifupdown

The functionality of the `ifupdown` package can be improved beyond what was described in <<_the_basic_network_configuration_with_ifupdown>> with the advanced knowledge.  

The functionalities described here are completely optional.  I, being lazy and minimalist, rarely bother to use these.

CAUTION: If you could not set up network connection by information in <<_the_basic_network_configuration_with_ifupdown>>, you make situation worse by using information below.

==== The ifplugd package

The `ifplugd` package is older automatic network configuration tool which can manage only Ethernet connections. This solves unplugged/replugged Ethernet cable issues for mobile PC etc.   If you have http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager[NetworkManager] or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicd_(Linux_Network_Manager)[Wicd] (see <<_automatic_network_configuration>>) installed, you do not need this package.

This package runs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computer_software)[daemon] and replaces **auto** or **allow-hotplug** functionalities (see <<list-of-stanzas-in-eni>>) and starts interfaces upon their connection to the network.  

Here is how to use the `ifplugd` package for the internal Ethernet port, e.g. `eth0`.

1. Remove stanza in "`/etc/network/interfaces`": "`auto eth0`" or "`allow-hotplug eth0`".
2. Keep stanza in "`/etc/network/interfaces`": "`iface eth0 inet ...`" and "`mapping ...`".
3. Install the `ifplugd` package.
4. Run "`sudo dpkg-reconfigure ifplugd`".
5. Put `eth0` as the "static interfaces to be watched by ifplugd".

Now, the network reconfiguration works as you desire.

- Upon power-on or upon hardware discovery, the interface is not brought up by itself.
 * Quick boot process without the long DHCP timeout.
 * No funny activated interface without proper IPv4 address (see <<_the_network_configuration_state_of_ifupdown>>).
- Upon finding the Ethernet cable, the interface is brought up. 
- Upon some time after unplugging the Ethernet cable, the interface is brought down automatically.  
- Upon plugging in another Ethernet cable, the interface is brought up under the new network environment.

TIP: The arguments for the `ifplugd`(8) command can set its behaviors such as the delay for reconfiguring interfaces.

// waproamd is removed
// {i} For the wireless LAN where the WEP key configuration before AP associations is required, you should check the {{{waproamd}}} package instead of the {{{ifplugd}}} package.

==== The ifmetric package

The `ifmeric` package enables us to manipulate metrics of routes a posteriori even for DHCP.

The following sets the `eth0` interface to be preferred over the `wlan0` interface.

1. Install the `ifmetric` package.
2. Add an option line with "`metric 0`" just below the "`iface eth0 inet dhcp`" line.
3. Add an option line with "`metric 1`" just below the "`iface wlan0 inet dhcp`" line.

The metric 0 means the highest priority route and is the default one.  The larger metric value means lower priority routes. The IP address of the active interface with the lowest metric value becomes the originating one. See `ifmetric`(8).

==== The virtual interface

A single physical Ethernet interface can be configured as multiple virtual interfaces with different IP addresses.  Usually the purpose is to connect an interface to several IP subnetworks.  For example, IP address based virtual web hosting by a single network interface is one such application.

For example, let@@@sq@@@s suppose the following.

- A single Ethernet interface on your host is connected to a Ethernet hub (not to the broadband router).
- The Ethernet hub is connected to both the Internet and LAN network.
- The LAN network uses subnet `192.168.0.x/24`.
- Your host uses DHCP served IP address with the physical interface `eth0` for the Internet.
- Your host uses `192.168.0.1` with the virtual interface `eth0:0` for the LAN.

The following stanzas in "`/etc/network/interfaces`" configure your network.

--------------------
iface eth0 inet dhcp
 metric 0
iface eth0:0 inet static
 address 192.168.0.1
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 network 192.168.0.0
 broadcast 192.168.0.255
 metric 1
--------------------

CAUTION: Although this configuration example with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation[network address translation (NAT)] using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter[netfilter/iptables] (see <<_netfilter_infrastructure>>) can provide cheap router for the LAN with only single interface, there is no real firewall capability with such set up.  You should use 2 physical interfaces with NAT to secure the local network from the Internet.

==== The advanced command syntax

The `ifupdown` package offers advanced network configuration using the  **network configuration** name and the **network interface** name.  I use slightly different terminology from one used in `ifup`(8) and `interfaces`(5).


.List of terminology for network devices
[grid="all"]
`---------------------------`------------------------------`-------------------------------------`----------------------------------------
manpage terminology         my terminology                 examples in the following text        description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**physical interface** name **network interface** name     `lo`, `eth0`, `<interface_name>`      name given by the Linux kernel (using `udev` mechanism)
**logical interface** name  **network configuration** name `config1`, `config2`, `<config_name>` name token following **`iface`** in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic network configuration commands in <<_the_command_syntax_simplified>> require the **network configuration** name token of the **`iface`** stanza to match the **network interface** name in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`".

Advanced network configuration commands enables separation of the **network configuration** name and the **network interface** name in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" as the following.

.List of advanced network configuration commands with ifupdown
[grid="all"]
`---------------------`-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
command               action
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`ifup eth0=config1`   bring up a network interface `eth0` with the configuration `config1`
`ifdown eth0=config1` bring down a network interface `eth0` with the configuration `config1`
`ifup eth0`           bring up a network interface `eth0` with the configuration selected by **`mapping`** stanza
`ifdown eth0`         bring down a network interface `eth0` with the configuration selected by **`mapping`** stanza
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== The mapping stanza

We skipped explaining the **`mapping`** stanza in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" in <<_the_basic_syntax_of_etc_network_interfaces>> to avoid complication.  This stanza has the following syntax.

--------------------
mapping <interface_name_glob>
 script <script_name>
 map <script_input1>
 map <script_input2>
 map ...
--------------------

This provides advanced feature to the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file by automating the choice of the configuration with the mapping script specified by `<script_name>`.

Let@@@sq@@@s follow the execution of the following.

--------------------
$ sudo ifup eth0
--------------------

When the "`<interface_name_glob>`" matches "`eth0`", this execution produces the execution of the following command to configure `eth0` automatically.

--------------------
$ sudo ifup eth0=$(echo -e '<script_input1> \n <script_input2> \n ...' | <script_name> eth0)
--------------------

Here, script input lines with "`map`" are optional and can be repeated.

NOTE: The glob for **`mapping`** stanza works like shell filename glob (see <<_shell_glob>>).

==== The manually switchable network configuration

Here is how to switch manually among several network configurations without rewriting the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file as in <<_the_basic_network_reconfiguration>> .

For all the network configuration you need to access, you create a single "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file as the following.

--------------------
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface config1 inet dhcp
 hostname "mymachine"

iface config2 inet static
 address 192.168.11.100
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 broadcast 192.168.11.255
 gateway 192.168.11.1
 dns-domain lan
 dns-nameservers 192.168.11.1

iface pppoe inet manual
 pre-up /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up
 up ifup ppp0=dsl
 down ifdown ppp0=dsl
 post-down /sbin/ifconfig eth0 down

# The following is used internally only
iface dsl inet ppp
 provider dsl-provider

iface pots inet ppp
 provider provider
--------------------

Please note the **network configuration name** which is the token after **`iface`** does not use the token for the **network interface name**.  Also, there are no **`auto`** stanza nor **`allow-hotplug`** stanza to start the network interface `eth0` automatically upon events.

Now you are ready to switch the network configuration.

Let@@@sq@@@s move your PC to a LAN served by the DHCP.  You bring up the **network interface** (the physical interface) `eth0` by assigning the **network configuration** name (the logical interface name) `config1` to it by the following.

--------------------
$ sudo ifup eth0=config1
Password:
...
--------------------

The interface `eth0` is up, configured by DHCP and connected to LAN.

--------------------
$ sudo ifdown eth0=config1
...
--------------------

The interface `eth0` is down and disconnected from LAN.

Let@@@sq@@@s move your PC to a LAN served by the static IP.  You bring up the **network interface** `eth0` by assigning the **network configuration** name `config2` to it by the following.

--------------------
$ sudo ifup eth0=config2
...
--------------------

The interface `eth0` is up, configured with static IP and connected to LAN. The additional parameters given as `dns-\*` configures "`/etc/resolv.conf`" contents.  This "`/etc/resolv.conf`" is better manged if the `resolvconf` package is installed.

--------------------
$ sudo ifdown eth0=config2
...
--------------------

The interface `eth0` is down and disconnected from LAN, again.

Let@@@sq@@@s move your PC to a port on BB-modem connected to the PPPoE served service.  You bring up the **network interface** `eth0` by assigning the **network configuration** name `pppoe` to it by the following.

--------------------
$ sudo ifup eth0=pppoe
...
--------------------

The interface `eth0` is up, configured with PPPoE connection directly to the ISP.

--------------------
$ sudo ifdown eth0=pppoe
...
--------------------

The interface `eth0` is down and disconnected, again.

Let@@@sq@@@s move your PC to a location without LAN or BB-modem but with POTS and modem.  You bring up the **network interface** `ppp0` by assigning the **network configuration** name `pots` to it by the following.

--------------------
$ sudo ifup ppp0=pots
...
--------------------

The interface `ppp0` is up and connected to the Internet with PPP.

--------------------
$ sudo ifdown ppp0=pots
...
--------------------

The interface `ppp0` is down and disconnected from the Internet.

You should check the "`/etc/network/run/ifstate`" file for the current network configuration state of the `ifupdown` system.

WARNING: You may need to adjust numbers at the end of `eth\*`, `ppp\*`, etc. if you have multiple network interfaces.

==== Scripting with the ifupdown system

The `ifupdown` system automatically runs scripts installed in "`/etc/network/\*/`" while exporting environment variables to scripts.

"`$ADDRFAM`"         <address_family> of the interface
"`$METHOD`"          <method_name> of the interface. (e.g., "static")
"`$MODE`"            "start" if run from `ifup`, "stop" if run from `ifdown`
"`$PHASE`"           as per "`$MODE`", but with finer granularity, distinguishing the `pre-up`, `post-up`, `pre-down` and `post-down` phases
"`$VERBOSITY`"       indicates whether "`--verbose`" was used; set to 1 if so, 0 if not
"`$PATH`"            command search path: "`/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`"
"`$IF_<OPTION>`"     value for the corresponding option under the **`iface`** stanza
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, each environment variable, "`$IF_<OPTION>`", is created from the name for the corresponding option such as <option1> and <option2> by prepending "`$IF_`", converting the case to the upper case, replacing hyphens to underscores, and discarding non-alphanumeric characters. 

TIP: See <<_the_basic_syntax_of_etc_network_interfaces>> for <address_family>, <method_name>, <option1> and <option2>.

The `ifupdown-extra` package (see <<_the_ifupdown_extra_package>>) uses these environment variables to extend the functionality of the `ifupdown` package.  The `ifmetric` package (see <<_the_ifmetric_package>>) installs the "`/etc/network/if-up.d/ifmetric`" script which sets the metric via the "`$IF_METRIC`" variable.  The `guessnet` package (see <<_mapping_with_guessnet>>), which provides simple and powerful framework for the auto-selection of the network configuration via the mapping mechanism, also uses these.

NOTE: For more specific examples of custom network configuration scripts using these environment variables, you should check example scripts in "`/usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/\*`" and scripts used in `ifscheme` and `ifupdown-scripts-zg2` packages.  These additional scripts have some overlaps of functionalities with basic `ifupdown-extra` and `guessnet` packages.  If you install these additional scripts, you should customize these scripts to avoid interferences.

==== Mapping with guessnet

Instead of manually choosing configuration as described in <<_the_manually_switchable_network_configuration>>, you can use the mapping mechanism described in <<_the_mapping_stanza>> to select network configuration automatically with custom scripts.

The `guessnet-ifupdown`(8) command provided by the `guessnet` package is designed to be used as a mapping script and provides powerful framework to enhance the `ifupdown` system.

- You list test condition as the value for **`guessnet`** options for each network configuration under **`iface`** stanza.
- Mapping choses the **`iface`** with first non-ERROR result as the network configuration.

This dual usage of the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file by the mapping script, `guessnet-ifupdown`, and the original network configuration infrastructure, `ifupdown`, does not cause negative impacts since **`guessnet`** options only export extra environment variables to scripts run by the `ifupdown` system.  See details in `guessnet-ifupdown`(8).

NOTE: When multiple **`guessnet`** option lines are required in "`/etc/network/interfaces`", use option lines started with **`guessnet1`**, **`guessnet2`**, and so on, since the `ifupdown` package does not allow starting strings of option lines to be repeated.

=== The network configuration for desktop

==== GUI network configuration tools

The capability of default GUI network configuration tools for each desktop environments such as GNOME tends to be limited to basic configurations such as static IP or DHCP.  They actually overwrite contents of "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file behind you. Please check how they change "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file by yourself.

CAUTION: They may not understand complicated advanced configuration done manually in "`/etc/network/interfaces`" file.

==== Automatic network configuration

There are independent automatic network configuration tools, such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager[NetworkManager (NM)] (`network-manager` and associated packages) and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicd_(Linux_Network_Manager)[Wicd] (`wicd` package) which manage network connection via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computer_software)[daemon] independent of the `ifupdown` package. They allow easy management of wireless connections.  These come with its own nice GUI user interfaces.

WARNING: Do not use these automatic network configuration tools for servers.  These are aimed primarily for mobile desktop users on laptops.

WARNING: These automatic network configuration tools are moving targets and documentation here is likely to be incorrect for `squeeze`.  So be warned.

CAUTION: These automatic network configuration tools may not be compatible with esoteric configurations of `ifupdown` in "`/etc/network/interfaces`" such as ones in <<_the_basic_network_configuration_with_ifupdown>> and <<_the_advanced_network_configuration_with_ifupdown>>.  Having even "`hostname`" stanza for DHCP controlled interface as described in <<_the_network_interface_served_by_the_dhcp>> caused NM to ignore such interface in `lenny`. Check http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?package=network-manager[BTS of network-manager] and http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?package=wicd[BTS of wicd] for current issues and limitations.  

The configuration of NM is described in "`/usr/share/doc/network-manager/README.Debian`".  Essentially this is as follows.

1. Make desktop user, e.g. `foo`, belong to group "`netdev`" by the following.
+
--------------------
$ sudo adduser foo netdev
--------------------
2. Keep configuration of "`/etc/network/interfaces`" as simple as the the following.
+
--------------------
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
--------------------
3. Restart NM by the following.
+
--------------------
$ sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart
--------------------

NOTE: Only interfaces which are **not** listed in "`/etc/network/interfaces`" or which have been configured with "`auto ...`" or "`allow-hotplug ...`" and "`iface ... inet dhcp`" (with no other options) are managed by NM to avoid conflict with `ifupdown`.

The configuration of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicd_(Linux_Network_Manager)[Wicd] is described in "`/usr/share/doc/wicd/README.Debian`".  Essentially, this is as follows.

1. Make configuration in "`/etc/network/interfaces`" only as the following.
+
--------------------
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
--------------------
2. Restart Wicd as the following.
+
--------------------
$ sudo /etc/init.d/wicd restart
--------------------

==== Finding optimal MTU

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit[Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)] value can be determined experimentally with `ping`(8) with "`-M do`" option which sends ICMP packets with data size starting from 1500 (with offset of 28 bytes for the IP+ICMP header) and finding the largest size without IP fragmentation.

For example, try the following

--------------------
$ ping -c 1 -s $((1500-28)) -M do www.debian.org
PING www.debian.org (194.109.137.218) 1472(1500) bytes of data.
From 192.168.11.2 icmp_seq=1 Frag needed and DF set (mtu = 1454)

--- www.debian.org ping statistics ---
0 packets transmitted, 0 received, +1 errors
--------------------

Try 1454 instead of 1500

You see `ping`(8) succeed with 1454.

This process is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_MTU_discovery[Path MTU (PMTU) discovery] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1191[RFC1191]) and the `tracepath`(8) command can automate this.  

TIP: The above example with PMTU value of 1454 is for my previous FTTP provider which used http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode[Asynchronous Transfer Mode] (ATM) as its backbone network and served its clients with the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet[PPPoE].  The actual PMTU value depends on your environment, e.g., 1500 for the my new FTTP provider.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addtion to these basic guide lines, you should know the following.

- Any use of tunneling methods (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network[VPN] etc.) may reduce optimal MTU further by their overheads.
- The MTU value should not exceed the experimentally determined PMTU value.
- The bigger MTU value is generally better when other limitations are met.

==== Setting MTU

Here are examples for setting the MTU value from its default 1500 to 1454.

For the DHCP (see <<_the_network_interface_served_by_the_dhcp>>), you can replace pertinent **`iface`** stanza lines in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" with the following.

--------------------
iface eth0 inet dhcp
 hostname "mymachine"
 pre-up /sbin/ifconfig $IFACE mtu 1454
--------------------

For the static IP (see <<_the_network_interface_with_the_static_ip>>), you can replace pertinent '''`iface`''' stanza lines in the "`/etc/network/interfaces`" with the following.

-------------------------
iface eth0 inet static
 address 192.168.11.100
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 broadcast 192.168.11.255
 gateway 192.168.11.1
 mtu 1454
 dns-domain lan
 dns-nameservers 192.168.11.1
--------------------------

For the direct PPPoE (see <<_the_pppoe_connection_with_pppoeconf>>), you can replace pertinent "`mtu`" line in the "`/etc/ppp/peers/dsl-provider`" with the following.

--------------------
mtu 1454
--------------------

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_segment_size[maximum segment size] (MSS) is used as an alternative measure of packet size.  The relationship between MSS and MTU are the following.

- MSS = MTU - 40 for IPv4
- MSS = MTU - 60 for IPv6

NOTE: The `iptables`(8) (see <<_netfilter_infrastructure>>) based optimization can clamp packet size by the MSS and is useful for the router.

==== WAN TCP optimization

The TCP throughput can be maximized by adjusting TCP buffer size parameters as described in "http://dsd.lbl.gov/TCP-tuning/[TCP Tuning Guide]" and "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_tuning[TCP tuning]"  for the modern high-bandwidth and high-latency WAN.  So far, the current Debian default settings serve well even for my LAN connected by the fast 1G bps FTTP service.

=== Netfilter infrastructure 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter[Netfilter] provides infrastructure for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful_firewall[stateful firewall] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation[network address translation (NAT)] with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel[Linux kernel] modules (see <<_the_kernel_module_initialization>>).

Main user space program of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter[netfilter] is `iptables`(8).  You can manually configure http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter[netfilter] interactively from shell, save its state with `iptables-save`(8), and restore it via init script with `iptables-restore`(8) upon system reboot.

Configuration helper scripts such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorewall[shorewall] ease this process.

See documentations at http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/[http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/] (or in "`/usr/share/doc/iptables/html/`").
