== Data management

// vim: set sts=2 expandtab:
// Use ":set nowrap" to edit table

Tools and tips for managing binary and text data on the Debian system are described.

WARNING:  The uncoordinated write access to actively accessed devices and files from multiple processes must not be done to avoid the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition[race condition].  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_locking[File locking] mechanisms using `flock`(1) may be used to avoid it.

=== Sharing, copying, and archiving

The security of the data and its controlled sharing have several aspects.

- The creation of data archive
- The remote storage access
- The duplication
- The tracking of the modification history
- The facilitation of data sharing
- The prevention of unauthorized file access
- The detection of unauthorized file modification

These can be realized by using some combination of tools.

- Archive and compression tools
- Copy and synchronization tools
- Network filesystems
- Removable storage media
- The secure shell
- The authentication system
- Version control system tools
- Hash and cryptographic encryption tools

==== Archive and compression tools

Here is a summary of archive and compression tools available on the Debian system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Do not set the "`$TAPE`" variable unless you know what to expect.  It changes `tar`(1) behavior.

NOTE: The gzipped `tar`(1) archive uses the file extension "`.tgz`" or "`.tar.gz`".

NOTE: The xz-compressed `tar`(1) archive uses the file extension "`.txz`" or "`.tar.xz`".

NOTE: Popular compression method in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software[FOSS] tools such as `tar`(1) has been moving as follows: `gzip` -> `bzip2` -> `xz`

NOTE: `cp`(1), `scp`(1) and `tar`(1) may have some limitation for special files.  `cpio`(1) and `afio`(1) are most versatile.

NOTE: `cpio`(1) and `afio`(1) are designed to be used with `find`(1) and other commands and suitable for creating backup scripts since the file selection part of the script can be tested independently.

NOTE: `afio`(1) compresses each file in the archive.  This makes `afio` to be much safer for the file corruption than the globally compressed `tar` or `cpio` archives and to be **the best archive engine** for the backup script.

NOTE: Internal structure of OpenOffice data files are "`.jar`" file.


==== Copy and synchronization tools

Here is a summary of simple copy and backup tools available on the Debian system.

.List of copy and synchronization tools
[grid="all"]
`----------------`-------------`------------`------`-------------------------------------------------------------------
package          popcon        size         tool   function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`coreutils`      @-@popcon1@-@ @-@psize1@-@ GNU cp locally copy files and directories ("-a" for recursive)
`openssh-client` @-@popcon1@-@ @-@psize1@-@ scp    remotely copy files and directories (client, "`-r`" for recursive)
`openssh-server` @-@popcon1@-@ @-@psize1@-@ sshd   remotely copy files and directories (remote server)
`rsync`          @-@popcon1@-@ @-@psize1@-@ -      1-way remote synchronization and backup
`unison`         @-@popcon1@-@ @-@psize1@-@ -      2-way remote synchronization and backup
`pdumpfs`        @-@popcon1@-@ @-@psize1@-@ -      daily local backup using hardlinks (similar to Plan9@@@sq@@@s `dumpfs`)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//|| Remote VCS || {{{cvs}}}, {{{subversion}}}, ... || 4265, 5276, ... || - || multi-way remote synchronization and backup (server-based). ||
//|| Distributed VCS || {{{git-core}}}, ... || 512, ... || - || multi-way  remote and local synchronization and backup (distributed). ||

Copying files with `rsync`(8) offers richer features than others.

- delta-transfer algorithm that sends only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination
- quick check algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size or in last-modified time
- "`--exclude`" and "`--exclude-from`" options similar to `tar`(1)
- "a trailing slash on the source directory" syntax that avoids creating an additional directory level at the destination.

TIP: Execution of the `bkup` script mentioned in <<_a_copy_script_for_the_data_backup>> with the "`-gl`" option under `cron`(8) should provide very similar functionality as `pdumpfs` for the static data archive.

TIP: Version control system (VCS) tools in <<list-of-vcs>> can function as the multi-way copy and synchronization tools.

==== Idioms for the archive

Here are several ways to archive and unarchive the entire content of the directory "`./source`" using different tools.

GNU `tar`(1):

--------------------
$ tar cvzf archive.tar.gz ./source
$ tar xvzf archive.tar.gz
--------------------

`cpio`(1):

--------------------
$ find ./source -xdev -print0 | cpio -ov --null > archive.cpio; gzip archive.cpio
$ zcat archive.cpio.gz | cpio -i
--------------------

`afio`(1):

--------------------
$ find ./source -xdev -print0 | afio -ovZ0 archive.afio
$ afio -ivZ archive.afio
--------------------

==== Idioms for the copy

Here are several ways to copy the entire content of the directory "`./source`" using different tools.

- Local copy: "`./source`" directory ->  "`/dest`" directory
- Remote copy: "`./source`" directory at local host -> "`/dest`" directory at "`user@host.dom`" host

`rsync`(8):

--------------------
# cd ./source; rsync -av . /dest
# cd ./source; rsync -av . user@host.dom:/dest
--------------------

You can alternatively use "a trailing slash on the source directory" syntax.

--------------------
# rsync -av ./source/ /dest
# rsync -av ./source/ user@host.dom:/dest
--------------------

GNU `cp`(1) and openSSH `scp`(1):

--------------------
# cd ./source; cp -a . /dest
# cd ./source; scp -pr . user@host.dom:/dest
--------------------

GNU `tar`(1):

--------------------
# (cd ./source && tar cf - . ) | (cd /dest && tar xvfp - )
# (cd ./source && tar cf - . ) | ssh user@host.dom '(cd /dest && tar xvfp - )'
--------------------

`cpio`(1):

--------------------
# cd ./source; find . -print0 | cpio -pvdm --null --sparse /dest
--------------------

`afio`(1):

--------------------
# cd ./source; find . -print0 | afio -pv0a /dest
--------------------

You can substitude "`.`" with "`foo`" for all examples containing "`.`" to copy files from "`./source/foo`" directory to "`/dest/foo`" directory.  

You can substitude "`.`" with the absolute path "`/path/to/source/foo`" for all examples containing "`.`" to drop "`cd ./source;`".  These will copy files to different locations depending on tools used as follows.

- "`/dest/foo`": `rsync`(8), GNU `cp`(1), and `scp`(1)
- "`/dest/path/to/source/foo`": GNU `tar`(1), `cpio`(1), and `afio`(1)

TIP: `rsync`(8) and GNU `cp`(1) have option "`-u`" to skip files that are newer on the receiver.

==== Idioms for the selection of files

`find`(1) is used to select files for archive and copy commands (see <<_idioms_for_the_archive>> and <<_idioms_for_the_copy>>) or for `xargs`(1) (see <<_repeating_a_command_looping_over_files>>).  This can be enhanced by using its command arguments.

Basic syntax of `find`(1) can be summarized as the following.

- Its conditional arguments are evaluated from left to right.
- This evaluation stops once its outcome is determined.
- "Logical **OR**" (specified by "`-o`" between conditionals) has lower precedence than "logical **AND**" (specified by "`-a`" or nothing between conditionals).
- "Logical **NOT**" (specified by "`!`" before a conditional) has higher precedence than "logical **AND**".
- "`-prune`" always returns logical **TRUE** and, if it is a directory, searching of file is stopped beyond this point.
- "`-name`" matches the base of the filename with shell glob (see <<_shell_glob>>) but it also matches its initial "`.`" with metacharacters such as "`\*`" and "`?`". (New http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX[POSIX] feature)
- "`-regex`" matches the full path with emacs style **BRE** (see <<_regular_expressions>>) as default.
- "`-size`" matches the file based on the file size (value precedented with "`+`" for larger, precedented with "`-`" for smaller)
- "`-newer`" matches the file newer than the one specified in its argument.
- "`-print0`" always returns logical **TRUE** and print the full filename (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character[null terminated]) on the standard output.

`find`(1) is often used with an idiomatic style as the following.

--------------------
# find /path/to \
    -xdev -regextype posix-extended \
    -type f -regex ".*\.afio|.*~" -prune -o \
    -type d -regex ".*/\.git" -prune -o \
    -type f -size +99M -prune -o \
    -type f -newer /path/to/timestamp -print0
--------------------

This means to do following actions.

1. Search all files starting from "`/path/to`"
2. Globally limit its search within its starting filesystem and uses **ERE** (see <<_regular_expressions>>) instead
3. Exclude files matching regex of "`.\*\.afio`" or "`.\*\~`" from search by stop processing
4. Exclude directories matching regex of "`.\*/\.git`" from search by stop processing
5. Exclude files larger than 99 Megabytes (units of 1048576 bytes) from search by stop processing
6. Print filenames which satisfy above search conditions and newer than "`/path/to/timestamp`"

Please note the idiomatic use of "`-prune -o`" to exclude files in the above example.

NOTE: For non-Debian http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like[Unix-like] system, some options may not be supported by `find`(1). In such a case, please consider to adjust matching methods and replace "`-print0`" with "`-print`".  You may need to adjust related commands too.

==== Backup and recovery

We all know that computers fail sometime or human errors cause system and data damages.  Backup and recovery operations are the essential part of successful system administration.  All possible failure modes hit you some day.

TIP: Keep your backup system simple and backup your system often.  Having backup data is more important than how technically good your backup method is.

There are 3 key factors which determine actual backup and recovery policy.

1. Knowing what to backup and recover.
 * Data files directly created by you: data in "`\~/`"
 * Data files created by applications used by you: data in "`/var/`" (except "`/var/cache/`", "`/var/run/`", and "`/var/tmp/`")
 * System configuration files: data in "`/etc/`"
 * Local softwares: data in "`/usr/local/`" or "`/opt/`"
 * System installation information: a memo in plain text on key steps (partition, ...)
 * Proven set of data: confirmed by experimental recovery operations in advance
2. Knowing how to backup and recover.
 * Secure storage of data: protection from overwrite and system failure
 * Frequent backup: scheduled backup
 * Redundant backup: data mirroring
 * Fool proof process: easy single command backup
3. Assessing risks and costs involved.
 * Value of data when lost
 * Required resources for backup: human, hardware, software, ...
 * Failure mode and their possibility

As for secure storage of data, data should be at least on different disk partitions preferably on different disks and machines to withstand the filesystem corruption.  Important data are best stored on a write-once media such as CD/DVD-R to prevent overwrite accidents.  (See <<_the_binary_data>> for how to write to the storage media from the shell commandline.  GNOME desktop GUI environment gives you easy access via menu: "Places->CD/DVD Creator".)

NOTE: You may wish to stop some application daemons such as MTA (see <<_mail_transport_agent_mta>>) while backing up data.

NOTE: You should pay extra care to the backup and restoration of identity related data files such as "`/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key`", "`/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key`", "`\~/.gnupg/\*`", "`\~/.ssh/\*`", "`/etc/passwd`", "`/etc/shadow`", "`/etc/fetchmailrc`", "`popularity-contest.conf`", "`/etc/ppp/pap-secrets`", and "`/etc/exim4/passwd.client`".  Some of these data can not be regenerated by entering the same input string to the system.

NOTE: If you run a cron job as a user process, you must restore files in "`/var/spool/cron/crontabs`" directory and restart `cron`(8).  See <<_scheduling_tasks_regularly>> for `cron`(8) and `crontab`(1).

==== Backup utility suites

Here is a select list of notable backup utility suites available on the Debian system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backup tools have their specialized focuses.

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondo_Rescue[Mondo Rescue] is a backup system to facilitate restoration of complete system quickly from backup CD/DVD etc. without going through normal system installation processes.
- `sbackup` and `keep` packages provide easy GUI frontend for desktop users to make regular backups of user data. An equivalent function can be realized by a simple script (<<_an_example_script_for_the_system_backup>>) and `cron`(8).
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacula[Bacula], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Maryland_Automatic_Network_Disk_Archiver[Amanda], and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backuppc[BackupPC] are full featured backup suite utilities which are focused on regular backups over network.

Basic tools described in <<_archive_and_compression_tools>> and <<_copy_and_synchronization_tools>> can be used to facilitate system backup via custom scripts.  Such script can be enhanced by the following.

- The `rdiff-backup` package enables incremental (remote) backups.
- The `dump` package helps to archive and restore the whole filesystem incrementally and efficiently.

TIP: See files in "`/usr/share/doc/dump/`" and http://dump.sourceforge.net/isdumpdeprecated.html["Is dump really deprecated?"] to lean about the `dump` package.

==== An example script for the system backup

For a personal Debian desktop system running `unstable` suite, I only need to protect personal and critical data.  I reinstall system once a year anyway.  Thus I see no reason to backup the whole system or to install a full featured backup utility.

I use a simple script to make a backup archive and burn it into CD/DVD using GUI.  Here is an example script for this.

--------------------
#!/bin/sh -e

} | cpio -ov --null -O $BUDIR/BU$DATE.cpio
chown $BUUID $BUDIR/BU$DATE.cpio
touch $BUDIR/backup.stamp
--------------------

This is meant to be a script example executed from root.

I expect you to change and execute this as follows.

- Edit this script to cover all your important data (see <<_idioms_for_the_selection_of_files>> and <<_backup_and_recovery>>).
- Replace "`find ... -print0`" with "`find ... -newer $BUDIR/backup.stamp -print0`" to make a incremental backup.
- Transfer backup files to the remote host using `scp`(1) or `rsync`(1) or burn them to CD/DVD for extra data security.  (I use GNOME desktop GUI for burning CD/DVD. See <<_shell_script_example_with_zenity>> for extra redundancy.)

Keep it simple!

TIP: You can recover debconf configuration data with "`debconf-set-selections debconf-selections`" and dpkg selection data with "`dpkg --set-selection <dpkg-selections.list`".

==== A copy script for the data backup 

For the set of data under a directory tree, the copy with "`cp -a`" provides the normal backup.

For the set of large non-overwritten static data under a directory tree such as the one under the "`/var/cache/apt/packages/`" directory, hardlinks with "`cp -al`" provide an alternative to the normal backup with efficient use of the disk space.

Here is a copy script, which I named as `bkup`, for the data backup. This script copies all (non-VCS) files under the current directory to the dated directory on the parent directory or on a remote host.

TIP: I keep this `bkup` in my "`/usr/local/bin/`" directory.  I issue this `bkup` command without any option in the working directory whenever I need a temporary snapshot backup.

TIP: For making snapshot history of a source file tree or a configuration file tree, it is easier and space efficient to use `git`(7) (see <<_git_for_recording_configuration_history>>).

==== Removable storage device

Removable storage devices may be any one of the following.

- Hard disk
- Any format of flash memory devices
- Digital camera which are connected via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus[USB], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394_interface[IEEE 1394 / Firewire], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_card[PC Card], etc.

These removable storage devices can be automatically mounted as a user under modern desktop environment, such as GNOME using `gnome-mount`(1).  

- Mount point under GNOME is chosen as "`/media/<disk_label>`" which can be customized by the following. 
 * `mlabel`(1) for FAT filesystem
 * `genisoimage`(1) with "`-V`" option for ISO9660 filesystem
 * `tune2fs`(1) with "`-L`" option for ext2/ext3 filesystem 
- The choice of encoding may need to be provided as mount option (see <<_filename_encoding>>).
- The ownership of the mounted filesystem may need to be adjusted for use by the normal user. 

NOTE: Automounting under modern desktop environment happens only when those removable media devices are not listed in "`/etc/fstab`".

TIP: When providing wrong mount option causes problem, erase its corresponding setting under "`/system/storage/`" via `gconf-editor`(1).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TIP: See <<_removable_disk_encryption_with_dm_crypt_luks>> for cross platform sharing of data using device level encryption.

The FAT filesystem is supported by almost all modern operating systems and is quite useful for the data exchange purpose via removable hard disk like media.

When formatting removable hard disk like devices for cross platform sharing of data with the FAT filesystem, the following should be safe choices.

- Partitioning them with `fdisk`(8), `cfdisk`(8) or `parted`(8) (see <<_disk_partition_configuration>>) into a single primary partition and to mark it as the following.
 * Type "6" for FAT16 for media smaller than 2GB.
 * Type "c" for FAT32 (LBA) for larger media.
- Formatting the primary partition with `mkfs.vfat`(8) with the following.
 * Just its device name, e.g. "`/dev/sda1`" for FAT16
 * The explicit option and its device name, e.g. "`-F 32 /dev/sda1`" for FAT32

When using the FAT or ISO9660 filesystems for sharing data, the following should be the safe considerations.

- Archiving files into an archive file first using `tar`(1), `cpio`(1), or `afio`(1) to retain the long filename, the symbolic link, the original Unix file permission and the owner information.
- Splitting the archive file into less than 2 GiB chunks with the `split`(1) command to protect it from the file size limitation.
- Encrypting the archive file to secure its contents from the unauthorized access.

NOTE: For FAT filesystems by its design, the maximum file size is `(2\^32 - 1) bytes = (4GiB - 1 byte)`. For some applications on the older 32 bit OS, the maximum file size was even smaller `(2\^31 - 1) bytes = (42GiB - 1 byte)`.  Debian does not suffer the latter problem.

NOTE: Microsoft itself does not recommend to use FAT for drives or partitions of over 200 MB.  Microsoft highlights its short comings such as inefficient disk space usage in their "http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100108/[Overview of FAT, HPFS, and NTFS File Systems]".  Of course, we should normally use the ext3 filesystem for Linux.

TIP: For more on filesystems and accessing filesystems, please read "http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Filesystems-HOWTO.html[Filesystems HOWTO]".

==== Sharing data via network

When sharing data with other system via network, you should use common service. Here are some hints.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although these filesystems mounted over network and file transfer methods over network are quite convenient for sharing data, these may be insecure.  Their network connection must be secured by the following.

- Encrypt it with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[SSL/TLS]
- Tunnel it via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell[SSH]
- Tunnel it via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network[VPN]
- Limit it behind the secure firewall

See also <<_other_network_application_servers>> and <<_other_network_application_clients>>.

==== Archive media

When choosing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage[computer data storage media] for important data archive, you should be careful about their limitations.  For small personal data backup, I use CD-R and DVD-R by the brand name company and store in a cool, shaded, dry, clean environment.  (Tape archive media seem to be popular for professional use.)

NOTE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe[A fire-resistant safe] are meant for paper documents.  Most of the computer data storage media have less temperature tolerance than paper. I usually rely on multiple secure encrypted copies stored in multiple secure locations.

Optimistic storage life of archive media seen on the net (mostly from vendor info).

-  100+ years : Acid free paper with ink
-  100  years : Optical storage  (CD/DVD, CD/DVD-R)
-   30  years : Magnetic storage (tape, floppy)
-   20  years : Phase change optical storage (CD-RW)

These do not count on the mechanical failures due to handling etc.

Optimistic write cycle of archive media seen on the net (mostly from vendor info).

-  250,000+ cycles : Harddisk drive
-   10,000+ cycles : Flash memory
-    1,000  cycles : CD/DVD-RW
-        1  cycles : CD/DVD-R, paper

CAUTION: Figures of storage life and write cycle here should not be used for decisions on any critical data storage.   Please consult the specific product information provided by the manufacture.

TIP: Since CD/DVD-R and paper have only 1 write cycle, they inherently prevent accidental data loss by overwriting.  This is advantage!

TIP: If you need fast and frequent backup of large amount of data, a hard disk on a remote host linked by a fast network connection, may be the only realistic option.

=== The disk image

Here, we discuss manipulations of the disk image.  See <<_data_storage_tips>>, too.

==== Making the disk image file

The disk image file, "`disk.img`", of an unmounted device, e.g., the second SCSI drive "`/dev/sdb`", can be made using `cp`(1) or `dd`(1) by the following.

--------------------
# cp /dev/sdb disk.img
# dd if=/dev/sdb of=disk.img
--------------------

The disk image of the traditional PC@@@sq@@@s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record[master boot record (MBR)] (see <<_disk_partition_configuration>>) which reside on the first sector on the primary IDE disk can be made by using `dd`(1) by the following.

--------------------
# dd if=/dev/hda of=mbr.img bs=512 count=1
# dd if=/dev/hda of=mbr-nopart.img bs=446 count=1
# dd if=/dev/hda of=mbr-part.img skip=446 bs=1 count=66
--------------------

- "`mbr.img`": The MBR with the partition table
- "`mbr-nopart.img`": The MBR without the partition table
- "`part.img`": The partition table of the MBR only

If you have a SCSI device (including the new serial ATA drive) as the boot disk, substitute "`/dev/hda`" with "`/dev/sda`".

If you are making an image of a disk partition of the original disk, substitute "`/dev/hda`" with "`/dev/hda1`" etc.

==== Writing directly to the disk

The disk image file, "`disk.img`" can be written to an unmounted device, e.g., the second SCSI drive "`/dev/sdb`" with matching size, by the following.

--------------------
# dd if=disk.img of=/dev/sdb
--------------------

Similarly, the disk partition image file, "`partition.img`" can be written to an unmounted partition, e.g., the first partition of the second SCSI drive "`/dev/sdb1`" with matching size, by the following.

--------------------
# dd if=partition.img of=/dev/sdb1
--------------------

==== Mounting the disk image file

The disk image "`partition.img`" containing a single partition image can be mounted and unmounted by using the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device[loop device] as follows.

--------------------
# losetup -v -f partition.img
Loop device is /dev/loop0
# mkdir -p /mnt/loop0
# mount -t auto /dev/loop0 /mnt/loop0
...hack...hack...hack
# umount /dev/loop0
# losetup -d /dev/loop0
--------------------

This can be simplified as follows.

--------------------
# mkdir -p /mnt/loop0
# mount -t auto -o loop partition.img /mnt/loop0
...hack...hack...hack
# umount partition.img
--------------------

Each partition of the disk image "`disk.img`" containing multiple partitions can be mounted by using the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device[loop device].  Since the loop device does not manage partitions by default, we need to reset it as follows.

--------------------
# modinfo -p loop # verify kernel capability
max_part:Maximum number of partitions per loop device
max_loop:Maximum number of loop devices
# losetup -a # verify nothing using the loop device
# rmmod loop
# modprobe loop max_part=16
--------------------

Now, the loop device can manage up to 16 partitions.

--------------------
# losetup -v -f disk.img
Loop device is /dev/loop0
# fdisk -l /dev/loop0

Disk /dev/loop0: 5368 MB, 5368709120 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 652 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x452b6464

      Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/loop0p1               1         600     4819468+  83  Linux
/dev/loop0p2             601         652      417690   83  Linux
# mkdir -p /mnt/loop0p1
# mount -t ext3 /dev/loop0p1 /mnt/loop0p1
# mkdir -p /mnt/loop0p2
# mount -t ext3 /dev/loop0p2 /mnt/loop0p2
...hack...hack...hack
# umount /dev/loop0p1
# umount /dev/loop0p2
# losetup -d /dev/loop0
--------------------

Alternatively, similar effects can be done by using the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper[device mapper] devices created by `kpartx`(8) from the `kpartx` package as follows.

--------------------
# kpartx -a -v disk.img
...
# mkdir -p /mnt/loop0p2
# mount -t ext3 /dev/mapper/loop0p2 /mnt/loop0p2
...
...hack...hack...hack
# umount /dev/mapper/loop0p2
...
# kpartx -d /mnt/loop0
--------------------

NOTE: You can mount a single partition of such disk image with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device[loop device] using offset to skip http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record[MBR] etc., too.  But this is more error prone.

==== Cleaning a disk image file

A disk image file, "`disk.img`" can be cleaned of all removed files into clean sparse image "`new.img`" by the following.

--------------------
# mkdir old; mkdir new
# mount -t auto -o loop disk.img old
# dd bs=1 count=0 if=/dev/zero of=new.img seek=5G
# mount -t auto -o loop new.img new
# cd old
# cp -a --sparse=always ./ ../new/
# cd ..
# umount new.img
# umount disk.img
--------------------

If "`disk.img`" is in ext2 or ext3, you can also use `zerofree`(8) from the `zerofree` package as follows.

--------------------
# losetup -f -v disk.img
Loop device is /dev/loop3
# zerofree /dev/loop3
# cp --sparse=always disk.img new.img
--------------------

==== Making the empty disk image file

The empty disk image "`disk.img`" which can grow up to 5MiB can be made using `dd`(1) as follows.

--------------------
$ dd bs=1 count=0 if=/dev/zero of=disk.img seek=5G
--------------------

You can create an ext3 filesystem on this disk image "`disk.img`" using the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device[loop device] as follows.

--------------------
# losetup -f -v disk.img
Loop device is /dev/loop1
# mkfs.ext3 /dev/loop1
...hack...hack...hack
# losetup -d /dev/loop1 
$ du  --apparent-size -h disk.img
5.0G  disk.img
$ du -h disk.img
83M disk.img
--------------------

For "`disk.img`", its file size is 5.0 GiB and its actual disk usage is mere 83MiB.  This discrepancy is possible since http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3[ext2fs] can hold http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file[sparse file]. 

TIP: The actual disk usage of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file[sparse file] grows with data which are written to it.

Using similar operation on devices created by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device[loop device] or the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper[device mapper] devices as  <<_mounting_the_disk_image_file>>, you can partition this disk image "`disk.img`" using `parted`(8) or `fdisk`(8), and can create filesystem on it using `mkfs.ext3`(8), `mkswap`(8), etc. 

==== Making the ISO9660 image file

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660[ISO9660] image file, "`cd.iso`", from the source directory tree at "`source_directory`" can be made using `genisoimage`(1) provided by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdrkit[cdrkit] by the following.

--------------------
#  genisoimage -r -J -T -V volume_id -o cd.iso source_directory
--------------------

Similarly, the bootable ISO9660 image file, "`cdboot.iso`", can be made from `debian-installer` like directory tree at "`source_directory`" by the following.

--------------------
#  genisoimage -r -o cdboot.iso -V volume_id \
   -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
   -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table source_directory
--------------------

Here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYSLINUX[Isolinux boot loader] (see <<_stage_2_the_boot_loader>>) is used for booting.

You can calculate the md5sum value and make the ISO9660 image directly from the CD-ROM device as follows.

-------------------
$ isoinfo -d -i /dev/cdrom
CD-ROM is in ISO 9660 format
...
Logical block size is: 2048
Volume size is: 23150592
...
# dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=2048 count=23150592 conv=notrunc,noerror | md5sum
# dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=2048 count=23150592 conv=notrunc,noerror > cd.iso
-------------------

WARNING: You must carefully avoid ISO9660 filesystem read ahead bug of Linux as above to get the right result.

==== Writing directly to the CD/DVD-R/RW

TIP: DVD is only a large CD to `wodim`(1) provided by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdrkit[cdrkit].

You can find a usable device by the following.

--------------------
# wodim --devices
--------------------

Then the blank CD-R is inserted to the CD drive, and the ISO9660 image file, "`cd.iso`" is written to this device, e.g., "`/dev/hda`", using `wodim`(1) by the following.

--------------------
# wodim -v -eject dev=/dev/hda cd.iso
--------------------

If CD-RW is used instead of CD-R, do this instead by the following.

--------------------
# wodim -v -eject blank=fast dev=/dev/hda cd.iso
--------------------

TIP: If your desktop system mounts CD automatically, unmount it by "`sudo unmount /dev/hda`" before using `wodim`(1).

==== Mounting the ISO9660 image file

If "`cd.iso`" contains an ISO9660 image, then the following manually mounts it to "`/cdrom`".

--------------------
# mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop cd.iso /cdrom
--------------------

TIP: Modern desktop system mounts removable media automatically (see <<_removable_storage_device>>).

=== The binary data

==== Splitting a large file into small files

When a data is too big to backup as a single file, you can backup its content after splitting it into, e.g. 2000MiB chunks and merge those chunks back into the original file later.

--------------------
$ split -b 2000m large_file
$ cat x* >large_file
--------------------

CAUTION: Please make sure you do not have any files starting with "`x`" to avoid name crashes.

==== Clearing file contents

In order to clear the contents of a file such as a log file, do not use `rm`(1) to delete the file and then create a new empty file, because the file may still be accessed in the interval between commands.  The following is the safe way to clear the contents of the file.

--------------------
$ :>file_to_be_cleared
--------------------

==== Dummy files

The following commands create dummy or empty files.

--------------------
$ dd if=/dev/zero    of=5kb.file bs=1k count=5
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=7mb.file bs=1M count=7
$ touch zero.file
$ : > alwayszero.file
--------------------

You should find following files.

- "`5kb.file`" is 5KB of zeros.
- "`7mb.file`" is 7MB of random data.
- "`zero.file`" may be a 0 byte file.  If it existed, its `mtime` is updated while its content and its length are kept.
- "`alwayszero.file`" is always a 0 byte file.  If it existed, its `mtime` is updated and its content is reset.

==== Erasing an entire hard disk

There are several ways to completely erase data from an entire hard disk like device, e.g., USB memory stick at "`/dev/sda`".

CAUTION: Check your USB memory stick location with `mount`(8) first before executing commands here.  The device pointed by "`/dev/sda`" may be SCSI hard disk or serial-ATA hard disk where your entire system resides.

Erase all the disk content by resetting data to 0 with the following.

--------------------
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
--------------------

Erase all by overwriting random data with the following.

--------------------
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda
--------------------

Erase all by overwriting random data very efficiently with the following.

--------------------
# shred -v -n 1 /dev/sda
--------------------

Since `dd`(1) is available from the shell of many bootable Linux CDs such as Debian installer CD, you can erase your installed system completely by running an erase command from such media on the system hard disk, e.g., "`/dev/hda`", "`/dev/sda`", etc.

//# $ sudo time dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdd; sudo time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd; sudo time shred -v -n 1 /dev/sdd
//# [sudo] password for osamu:

==== Erasing unused area of an hard disk

Unused area on an hard disk (or USB memory stick), e.g. "`/dev/sdb1`" may still contain erased data themselves since they are only unlinked from the filesystem.  These can be cleaned by overwriting them.

--------------------
# mount -t auto /dev/sdb1 /mnt/foo
# cd /mnt/foo
# dd if=/dev/zero of=junk
dd: writing to `junk': No space left on device
... 
# sync
# umount /dev/sdb1
--------------------

WARNING: This is usually a good enough for your USB memory stick.  But this is not perfect.  Most parts of erased filenames and their attributes may be hidden and remain in the filesystem.

==== Undeleting deleted but still open files

Even if you have accidentally deleted a file, as long as that file is still being used by some application (read or write mode), it is possible to recover such a file.

For example, try the following

--------------------
$ echo foo > bar
$ less bar
$ ps aux | grep ' less[ ]'
bozo    4775  0.0  0.0  92200   884 pts/8    S+   00:18   0:00 less bar
$ rm bar
$ ls -l /proc/4775/fd | grep bar
lr-x------ 1 bozo bozo 64 2008-05-09 00:19 4 -> /home/bozo/bar (deleted)
$ cat /proc/4775/fd/4 >bar
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4 2008-05-09 00:25 bar
$ cat bar
foo
--------------------

Execute on another terminal (when you have the `lsof` package installed) as follows.

--------------------
$ ls -li bar
2228329 -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4 2008-05-11 11:02 bar
$ lsof |grep bar|grep less
less 4775 bozo 4r REG 8,3 4 2228329 /home/bozo/bar
$ rm bar
$ lsof |grep bar|grep less
less 4775 bozo 4r REG 8,3 4 2228329 /home/bozo/bar (deleted)
$ cat /proc/4775/fd/4 >bar
$ ls -li bar
2228302 -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4 2008-05-11 11:05 bar
$ cat bar
foo
--------------------

==== Searching all hardlinks

Files with hardlinks can be identified by "`ls -li`".

--------------------
$ ls -li
total 0
2738405 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2008-09-15 20:21 bar
2738404 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 0 2008-09-15 20:21 baz
2738404 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 0 2008-09-15 20:21 foo
--------------------

Both "`baz`" and "`foo`" have link counts of "2" (>1) showing them to have hardlinks.  Their http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode[inode] numbers are common "2738404".  This means they are the same hardlinked file.  If you do not happen to find all hardlinked files by chance, you can search it by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode[inode], e.g., "2738404" as the following.

--------------------
# find /path/to/mount/point -xdev -inum 2738404 
--------------------

==== Invisible disk space consumption

All deleted but open files consumes disk space although they are not visible from normal `du`(1).  They can be listed with their size by the following.

--------------------
# lsof -s -X / |grep deleted
--------------------

=== Data security infrastructure

The data security infrastructure is provided by the combination of data encryption tool, message digest tool, and signature tool.

Here is the meaning of the trust code.

.List of the meaning of the trust code
[grid="all"]
`----`---------------------------------------------
code description of trust                                         
---------------------------------------------------
`-`  no owner trust assigned / not yet calculated
`e`  trust calculation failed
`q`  not enough information for calculation
`n`  never trust this key
`m`  marginally trusted
`f`  fully trusted
`u`  ultimately trusted
---------------------------------------------------

The following uploads my key "`A8061F32`" to the popular keyserver "`hkp://subkeys.pgp.net`".

--------------------
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --send-keys A8061F32
--------------------

A good default keyserver set up in "`\~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`" (or old location "`\~/.gnupg/options`") contains the following.

--------------------
keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
--------------------

The following obtains unknown keys from the keyserver.

--------------------
$ gpg --list-sigs | \
  sed -n '/^sig.*\[User ID not found\]/s/^sig..........\(\w\w*\)\W.*/\1/p' |\
  sort | uniq | xargs gpg --recv-keys
--------------------

There was a bug in http://sourceforge.net/projects/pks/[OpenPGP Public Key Server] (pre version 0.9.6) which corrupted key with more than 2 sub-keys.  The newer `gnupg` (>1.2.1-2) package can handle these corrupted subkeys.  See `gpg`(1) under "`--repair-pks-subkey-bug`" option.

==== Using GnuPG on files

Here are examples for using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard[GNU Privacy Guard] commands on files.

`gpg -o file --decrypt crypt_file.gpg`                  , ,
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Using GnuPG with Mutt

Add the following to "`\~/.muttrc`" to keep a slow GnuPG from automatically
starting, while allowing it to be used by typing "`S`" at the index menu.

--------------------
macro index S ":toggle pgp_verify_sig\n"
set pgp_verify_sig=no
--------------------

==== Using GnuPG with Vim

The `gnupg` plugin let you run GnuPG transparently for files with extension "`.gpg`", "`.asc`", and "`.ppg`".

--------------------
# aptitude install vim-scripts vim-addon-manager
$ vim-addons install gnupg
--------------------

==== The MD5 sum

`md5sum`(1) provides utility to make a digest file using the method in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321[rfc1321] and verifying each file with it.

--------------------
$ md5sum foo bar >baz.md5
$ cat baz.md5
d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00  foo
c157a79031e1c40f85931829bc5fc552  bar
$ md5sum -c baz.md5
foo: OK
bar: OK
--------------------

NOTE: The computation for the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5[MD5] sum is less CPU intensive than the one for the cryptographic signature by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard[GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)]. Usually, only the top level digest file is cryptographically signed to ensure data integrity.

=== Source code merge tools

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Extracting differences for source files

One of following procedures extract differences between two source files and create unified diff files "`file.patch0`" or "`file.patch1`" depending on the file location.

--------------------
$ diff -u file.old file.new > file.patch0
$ diff -u old/file new/file > file.patch1
--------------------

==== Merging updates for source files

The diff file (alternatively called patch file) is used to send a program update.  The receiving party applies this update to another file by the following.

--------------------
$ patch -p0 file < file.patch0
$ patch -p1 file < file.patch1
--------------------

==== Updating via 3-way-merge

If you have three versions of a source code, you can perform 3-way-merge effectively using `diff3`(1) by the following.

--------------------
$ diff3 -m file.mine file.old file.yours > file
--------------------

=== Version control systems

Here is a summary of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control[version control systems (VCS)] on the Debian system.

//# || {{{bazaar}}} || - || - || [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar_(software) Bazaar] || distributed || DVCS based on {{{tla}}} implemented in C. (Historic) ||

VCS is sometimes known as revision control system (RCS), or software configuration management (SCM).

Distributed VCS such as Git is the tool of choice these days.  CVS and Subversion may still be useful to join some existing open source program activities.

Debian provides free VCS services via http://alioth.debian.org/[Debian Alioth service].  It supports practically all VCSs. Its documentation can be found at http://wiki.debian.org/Alioth .

CAUTION: The `git` package was "GNU Interactive Tools" and the `git-core` package was DVCS in `lenny`.

There are few basics for creating a shared access VCS archive.

- Use "`umask 002`" (see <<_control_of_permissions_for_newly_created_files_umask>>)
- Make all VCS archive files belonging to a pertinent group
- Enable set group ID on all VCS archive directories (BSD-like file creation scheme, see <<_filesystem_permissions>>)
- Make user sharing the VCS archive belonging to the group

==== Comparison of VCS commands

Here is an oversimplified comparison of native VCS commands to provide the big picture. The typical command sequence may require options and arguments.

CAUTION: Invoking a `git` subcommand directly as "`git-xyz`" from the command line has been deprecated since early 2006.

TIP: GUI tools such as `tkcvs`(1) and `gitk`(1) really help you with tracking revision history of files.  The web interface provided by many public archives for browsing their repositories is also quite useful, too.

// === Git commands to work directly with different VCS repositories ===
// Here is an oversimplified summary of commands to provide the big picture.
// The typical command sequence may require options and arguments.
//
// Nice to have table here.

TIP: Git can work directly with different VCS repositories such as ones provided by CVS and Subversion, and provides the local repository for local changes with `git-cvs` and `git-svn` packages.  See http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitcvs-migration.html[git for CVS users], and <<_git_for_the_subversion_repository>>.

=== CVS

See the following.

- `cvs`(1)
- "`/usr/share/doc/cvs/html-cvsclient`"
- "`/usr/share/doc/cvs/html-info`"
- "`/usr/share/doc/cvsbook`"
- "`info cvs`"

====  Configuration of CVS repository

The following configuration allows commits to the CVS repository only by a member of the "`src`" group, and administration of CVS only by a member of the "`staff`" group, thus reducing the chance of shooting oneself.

--------------------
# cd /var/lib; umask 002; mkdir cvs
# export CVSROOT=/srv/cvs/project
# cd $CVSROOT
# chown root:src .
# chmod 2775 .
# cvs -d $CVSROOT init
# cd CVSROOT
# chown -R root:staff .
# chmod 2775 .
# touch val-tags
# chmod 664 history val-tags
# chown root:src history val-tags
--------------------

TIP: You may restrict creation of new project by changing the owner of "`$CVSROOT`" directory to "`root:staff`"  and its permission to "`3775`".

==== Local access to CVS

The default CVS repository is pointed by "`$CVSROOT`".  The following sets up "`$CVSROOT`" for the local access.

--------------------
$ export CVSROOT=/srv/cvs/project
--------------------

==== Remote access to CVS with pserver

Many public CVS servers provide read-only remote access to them with account name "`anonymous`" via pserver service.  For example, Debian web site contents are maintained by http://alioth.debian.org/projects/webwml/[webwml project] via CVS at Debian alioth service.  The following sets up "`$CVSROOT`" for the remote access to this CVS repository.

--------------------
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.alioth.debian.org:/cvsroot/webwml
$ cvs login
--------------------

NOTE: Since pserver is prone to eavesdropping attack and insecure, write access is usually disable by server administrators.

==== Remote access to CVS with ssh

The following sets up "`$CVS_RSH`" and "`$CVSROOT`" for the remote access to the CVS repository by http://alioth.debian.org/projects/webwml/[webwml project] with SSH.

--------------------
$ export CVS_RSH=ssh
$ export CVSROOT=:ext:account@cvs.alioth.debian.org:/cvs/webwml
--------------------

You can also use public key authentication for SSH which eliminates the remote password prompt.

==== Importing a new source to CVS

Create a new local source tree location at "`~/path/to/module1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ mkdir -p ~/path/to/module1; cd ~/path/to/module1
--------------------

Populate a new local source tree under "`~/path/to/module1`" with files.

Import it to CVS with the following parameters.

- Module name: "`module1`"
- Vendor tag: "`Main-branch`" (tag for the entire branch)
- Release tag: "`Release-initial`" (tag for a specific release)

--------------------
$ cd ~/path/to/module1
$ cvs import -m "Start module1" module1 Main-branch Release-initial
$ rm -Rf . # optional
--------------------

==== File permissions in CVS repository

CVS does not overwrite the current repository file but replaces it with another one.  Thus, write permission to the repository directory is critical.  For every new module for "`module1`" in repository at "`/srv/cvs/project`", run the following to ensure this condition if needed.

--------------------
# cd /srv/cvs/project
# chown -R root:src module1
# chmod -R ug+rwX   module1
# chmod    2775     module1
--------------------

==== Work flow of CVS

Here is an example of typical work flow using CVS.

Check all available modules from CVS project pointed by "`$CVSROOT`" by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs rls
CVSROOT
module1
module2
...
--------------------

Checkout "`module1`" to its default directory "`./module1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ cd ~/path/to
$ cvs co module1
$ cd module1
--------------------

Make changes to the content as needed.

Check changes by making "`diff -u [repository] [local]`" equivalent by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs diff -u
--------------------

You find that you broke some file "`file_to_undo`" severely but other files are fine.

Overwrite "`file_to_undo`" file with the clean copy from CVS by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs up -C file_to_undo
--------------------

Save the updated local source tree to CVS by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs ci -m "Describe change"
--------------------

Create and add "`file_to_add`" file to CVS by the following.

--------------------
$ vi file_to_add
$ cvs add file_to_add
$ cvs ci -m "Added file_to_add"
--------------------

Merge the latest version from CVS by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs up -d
--------------------

Watch out for lines starting with "`C filename`" which indicates conflicting changes.

Look for unmodified code in "`.#filename.version`".


Search for "`<<<<<<<`" and "`>>>>>>>`" in files for conflicting changes.

Edit files to fix conflicts as needed.

Add a release tag "`Release-1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs ci -m "last commit for Release-1"
$ cvs tag Release-1
--------------------


Edit further.

Remove the release tag "`Release-1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs tag -d Release-1
--------------------

Check in changes to CVS by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs ci -m "real last commit for Release-1"
--------------------

Re-add the release tag "`Release-1`" to updated CVS HEAD of main by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs tag Release-1
--------------------

Create a branch with a sticky branch tag "`Release-initial-bugfixes`" from the original version pointed by the tag "`Release-initial`" and check it out to "`~/path/to/old`" directory by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs rtag -b -r Release-initial Release-initial-bugfixes module1
$ cd ~/path/to
$ cvs co -r Release-initial-bugfixes -d old module1
$ cd old
--------------------

TIP: Use "`-D 2005-12-20`" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] date format) instead of "`-r Release-initial`" to specify particular date as the branch point.

Work on this local source tree having the sticky tag "`Release-initial-bugfixes`" which is based on the original version.

Work on this branch by yourself ... until someone else joins to this "`Release-initial-bugfixes`" branch.

Sync with files modified by others on this branch while creating new directories as needed by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs up -d
--------------------

Edit files to fix conflicts as needed.

Check in changes to CVS by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs ci -m "checked into this branch"
--------------------

Update the local tree by HEAD of main while removing sticky tag ("`-A`") and without keyword expansion ("`-kk`") by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs up -d -kk -A
--------------------

Update the local tree (content = HEAD of main) by merging from the "`Release-initial-bugfixes`" branch and without keyword expansion by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs up -d -kk -j Release-initial-bugfixes
--------------------

Fix conflicts with editor.

Check in changes to CVS by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs ci -m "merged Release-initial-bugfixes"
--------------------

Make archive by the following.

--------------------
$ cd ..
$ mv old old-module1-bugfixes
$ tar -cvzf old-module1-bugfixes.tar.gz old-module1-bugfixes
$ rm -rf old-module1-bugfixes
--------------------

TIP: "`cvs up`" command can take "`-d`" option to create new directories and "`-P`" option to prune empty directories.

TIP: You can checkout only a sub directory of "`module1`" by providing its name as "`cvs co module1/subdir`".

.Notable options for CVS commands (use as first argument(s) to `cvs`(1))
[grid="all"]
`------`----------------------------------------------
option meaning
------------------------------------------------------
`-n`   dry run, no effect
`-t`   display messages showing steps of cvs activity
------------------------------------------------------

==== Latest files from CVS

To get the latest files from CVS, use "`tomorrow`" by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs ex -D tomorrow module_name
--------------------

==== Administration of CVS

Add module alias "`mx`" to a CVS project (local server) by the following.

--------------------
$ export CVSROOT=/srv/cvs/project
$ cvs co CVSROOT/modules
$ cd CVSROOT
$ echo "mx -a module1" >>modules
$ cvs ci -m "Now mx is an alias for module1"
$ cvs release -d .
--------------------

Now, you can check out "`module1`" (alias: "`mx`") from CVS to "`new`" directory by the following.

--------------------
$ cvs co -d new mx
$ cd new
--------------------

NOTE: In order to perform above procedure, you should have appropriate file permissions.

==== Execution bit for CVS checkout

When you checkout files from CVS, their execution permission bit is retained.

Whenever you see execution permission problems in a checked out file, e.g. "`filename`", change its permission in the corresponding CVS repository by the following to fix it.

--------------------
# chmod ugo-x filename
--------------------

=== Subversion

Subversion is a **recent-generation** version control system replacing older CVS.  It has most of CVS@@@sq@@@s features except tags and branches.

You need to install `subversion`, `libapache2-svn` and `subversion-tools` packages to set up a Subversion server.

==== Configuration of Subversion repository

Currently, the `subversion` package does not set up a repository, so one must set it up manually.  One possible location for a repository is in "`/srv/svn/project`".

Create a directory by the following.

--------------------
# mkdir -p        /srv/svn/project
--------------------

Create the repository database by the following.

--------------------
# svnadmin create /srv/svn/project
--------------------

==== Access to Subversion via Apache2 server

If you only access Subversion repository via Apache2 server, you just need to make the repository only writable by the WWW server by the following.

--------------------
# chown -R www-data:www-data /srv/svn/project
--------------------

Add (or uncomment) the following in "`/etc/apache2/mods-available/dav_svn.conf`" to allow access to the repository via user authentication.

--------------------
<Location /project>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /srv/svn/project
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/subversion/passwd
<LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
    Require valid-user
</LimitExcept>
</Location>
--------------------

Create a user authentication file with the command by the following.

--------------------
# htpasswd2 -c /etc/subversion/passwd some-username
--------------------

Restart Apache2.

Your new Subversion repository is accessible at URL "`http://localhost/project`" and "`http://example.com/project`" from `svn`(1) (assuming your URL of web server is "`http://example.com/`").

==== Local access to Subversion by group

The following sets up Subversion repository for the local access by a group, e.g. `project`.

--------------------
# chmod  2775     /srv/svn/project
# chown -R root:src /srv/svn/project
# chmod -R ug+rwX   /srv/svn/project
--------------------

Your new Subversion repository is group accessible at URL "`file:@@@slash@@@//localhost/srv/svn/project`" or "`file:@@@slash@@@//srv/svn/project`" from `svn`(1) for local users belonging to `project` group.  You must run commands, such as `svn`, `svnserve`, `svnlook`, and `svnadmin` under "`umask 002`" to ensure group access.

==== Remote access to Subversion via SSH

A group accessible Subversion repository is at URL "`example.com:/srv/svn/project`" for SSH, you can access it from `svn`(1) at URL "`svn+ssh://example.com:/srv/svn/project`".

==== Subversion directory structure

Many projects uses directory tree similar to the following for Subversion to compensate its lack of branches and tags.

----------------------------------------
  ----- module1
    |   |-- branches
    |   |-- tags
    |   |   |-- release-1.0
    |   |   `-- release-2.0 
    |   |    
    |   `-- trunk
    |       |-- file1
    |       |-- file2
    |       `-- file3
    |
    `-- module2
----------------------------------------

TIP: You must use "`svn copy ...`" command to mark branches and tags.  This ensures Subversion to record modification history of files properly and saves storage spaces.

==== Importing a new source to Subversion

Create a new local source tree location at "`~/path/to/module1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ mkdir -p ~/path/to/module1; cd ~/path/to/module1
--------------------

Populate a new local source tree under "`~/path/to/module1`" with files.

Import it to Subversion with the following parameters.

- Module name: "`module1`"
- Subversion site URL: "`file:@@@slash@@@//srv/svn/project`"
- Subversion directory: "`module1/trunk`"
- Subversion tag: "`module1/tags/Release-initial`"

--------------------
$ cd ~/path/to/module1
$ svn import file:///srv/svn/project/module1/trunk -m "Start module1"
$ svn cp file:///srv/svn/project/module1/trunk file:///srv/svn/project/module1/tags/Release-initial
--------------------

Alternatively, by the following.

--------------------
$ svn import ~/path/to/module1 file:///srv/svn/project/module1/trunk -m "Start module1"
$ svn cp file:///srv/svn/project/module1/trunk file:///srv/svn/project/module1/tags/Release-initial
--------------------

TIP: You can replace URLs such as "`file:@@@slash@@@//...`" by any other URL formats such as "`http://...`" and "`svn+ssh://...`".

==== Work flow of Subversion

Here is an example of typical work flow using Subversion with its native client.

TIP: Client commands offered by the <package>git-svn</package> package may offer alternative work flow of Subversion using the <prgn>git</prgn> command.  See <<_git_for_the_subversion_repository>>.

Check all available modules from Subversion project pointed by URL "`file:///srv/svn/project`" by the following.

--------------------
$ svn list file:///srv/svn/project
module1
module2
...
--------------------


Checkout "`module1/trunk`" to a directory "`module1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ cd ~/path/to
$ svn co file:///srv/svn/project/module1/trunk module1
$ cd module1
--------------------

Make changes to the content as needed.

Check changes by making "`diff -u [repository] [local]`" equivalent by the following.

--------------------
$ svn diff
--------------------

You find that you broke some file "`file_to_undo`" severely but other files are fine.

Overwrite "`file_to_undo`" file with the clean copy from Subversion by the following.

--------------------
$ svn revert file_to_undo
--------------------

Save the updated local source tree to Subversion by the following.

--------------------
$ svn ci -m "Describe change"
--------------------

Create and add "`file_to_add`" file to Subversion by the following.

--------------------
$ vi file_to_add
$ svn add file_to_add
$ svn ci -m "Added file_to_add"
--------------------

Merge the latest version from Subversion by the following.

--------------------
$ svn up
--------------------

Watch out for lines starting with "`C filename`" which indicates conflicting changes.

Look for unmodified code in, e.g., "`filename.r6`", "`filename.r9`", and "`filename.mine`".

Search for "`<<<<<<<`" and "`>>>>>>>`" in files for conflicting changes.

Edit files to fix conflicts as needed.

Add a release tag "`Release-1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ svn ci -m "last commit for Release-1"
$ svn cp file:///srv/svn/project/module1/trunk file:///srv/svn/project/module1/tags/Release-1
--------------------

Edit further.

Remove the release tag "`Release-1`" by the following.

--------------------
$ svn rm file:///srv/svn/project/module1/tags/Release-1
--------------------

Check in changes to Subversion by the following.

--------------------
$ svn ci -m "real last commit for Release-1"
--------------------

Re-add the release tag "`Release-1`" from updated Subversion HEAD of trunk by the following.

--------------------
$ svn cp file:///srv/svn/project/module1/trunk file:///srv/svn/project/module1/tags/Release-1
--------------------

Create a branch with a path "`module1/branches/Release-initial-bugfixes`" from the original version pointed by the path "`module1/tags/Release-initial`" and check it out to "`~/path/to/old`" directory by the following.

--------------------
$ svn cp file:///srv/svn/project/module1/tags/Release-initial file:///srv/svn/project/module1/branches/Release-initial-bugfixes
$ cd ~/path/to
$ svn co file:///srv/svn/project/module1/branches/Release-initial-bugfixes old
$ cd old
--------------------

TIP: Use "`module1/trunk@\{2005-12-20\}`" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] date format) instead of "`module1/tags/Release-initial`" to specify particular date as the branch point.

Work on this local source tree pointing to branch "`Release-initial-bugfixes`" which is based on the original version.

Work on this branch by yourself ... until someone else joins to this "`Release-initial-bugfixes`" branch.

Sync with files modified by others on this branch by the following.

--------------------
$ svn up

=== Git

Git can do everything for both local and remote source code management.  This means that you can record the source code changes without needing network connectivity to the remote repository.

====  Configuration of Git client

You may wish to set several global configuration in "`\~/.gitconfig`" such as your name and email address used by Git by the following.

--------------------
$ git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
$ git config --global user.email yourname@example.com
--------------------

If you are too used to CVS or Subversion commands, you may wish to set several command aliases  by the following.

--------------------
$ git config --global alias.ci "commit -a"
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
--------------------

You can check your global configuration by the following.

--------------------
$ git config --global --list

`git-gui`(1) and `gitk`(1) commands make using Git very easy.

WARNING: Do not use the tag string with spaces in it even if some tools such as `gitk`(1) allow you to use it.  It may choke some other `git` commands.

==== Git commands

Even if your upstream uses different VCS, it may be good idea to use `git`(1) for local activity since you can manage your local copy of source tree without the network connection to the upstream.  Here are some packages and commands used with `git`(1).

TIP: With `git`(1), you work on a local branch with many commits and use something like "`git rebase -i master`" to reorganize change history later. This enables you to make clean change history.  See `git-rebase`(1) and `git-cherry-pick`(1).

==== Git for the Subversion repository

You can check out a Subversion repository to a local Git repository and commit back to the Subvesrion repository.  E.g.:

--------------------
$ git svn clone -s -rHEAD svn://svn.example.org/source dest
$ cd dest
... make changes
$ git commit -a
... keep working locally with git
$ git svn dcommit
--------------------

==== Git for recording configuration history

You can manually record chronological history of configuration using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)[Git] tools.  Here is a simple example for your practice to record "`/etc/apt/`" contents.

// sudo environment is assumed for realistic scenario.
// Please do not complain...

--------------------
$ cd /etc/apt/
$ sudo git init
$ sudo chmod 700 .git
$ sudo git add .
$ sudo git commit -a
--------------------

Commit configuration with description.

Make modification to the configuration files.

--------------------
$ cd /etc/apt/
$ sudo git commit -a
--------------------

Commit configuration with description and continue your life.

--------------------
$ cd /etc/apt/
$ sudo gitk --all
--------------------

You have full configuration history with you.

NOTE: `sudo`(8) is needed to work with any file permissions of configuration data.  For user configuration data, you may skip `sudo`.

NOTE: The "`chmod 700 .git`" command in the above example is needed to protect archive data from unauthorized read access.

TIP: For more complete setup for recording configuration history, please look for the `etckeeper` package: <<_recording_changes_in_configuration_files>>.
