<chapt id="basics">Basic rules
<p>
Development activity shall be cordial and shall conform to the 
following basic rules.
</p>
<p>
Although it is at sourceforge now, the project will probably
move to Debian some day.
</p>

<sect id="gpl">License
<p>
All contributions must be licensed under
both GPL and GFDL.
<footnote>
I know about the controversy surrounding the GFDL.
Please do not worry: I do not like GFDL either.
The dual licensing requirement is just
an extra safeguard that any part of this document may be combined
with any other part or with GFDL documents.
I consider even the GPL to be too restrictive and prefer the newer
BSD license, but I wanted the DR
to include bits from the Debian FAQ which is GPLed.
If there were only nice people in the world then we would not
need the GPL.
GFDL documentation may still be useful if it is high quality
document with partial freedom to everyone
while making publishing house happy. 
</footnote>
</p>
<p>
The official Debian Reference will only use GPL agreed contents,
so please rest assured.
</p>
</sect>

<sect id="style">General style
<p>
Make sure to keep to the spirit of "Quick Reference".
Do not write long wordy HOWTOs!
Pointers and shell scripts are the core of this document.
Contributors must follow STYLESHEET.en for the "SGML Style Guide".
</p>

</sect>

<sect id="encoding">Encoding of text data
<p>
Use traditional encodings.  <strong>No UTF-8 files allowed!!!</strong>
<example>
language encoding
en       en_US.ISO-8859-1
es       es_ES.ISO-8859-1
fi       fi_FI.ISO-8859-1
fr       fr_FR.ISO-8859-1
de       de_DE.ISO-8859-1
it       it_IT.ISO-8859-1
pl       pl_PL.ISO-8859-2
pt-br    pt_BR.ISO-8859-1
zh-cn    zh_CN.GBK
zh-tw    zh_TW BIG5
ja       ja_JP.eucJP
</example>
</p>

<chapt id="howto">How to contribute
<p>
Read documents under <url id="http://sf.net/docman/?group_id=1"
name="SourceForge.Net -&gt; Site Docs"> to get used to sf.net system.
"sourceforge.net" and "sf.net" are the same URL.
</p>
<sect id="enviroment">Work environment
<p>
Recommended OS for editing documents is the Sid version of 
<url id="http://www.debian.org" name="Debian GNU/Linux"> 
while Sarge is in testing :-) 
<p> 
Theoretically, you can use 
<url id="http://www.freebsd.com" name="FreeBSD">,
<url id="http://www.netbsd.org/" name="NetBSD"> or
<url id="http://www.openbsd.org/" name="OpenBSD"> as your platform, too.
<p>
You must be careful on the encoding issue.  Some newer environments
in various OSs are Unicode
which may create incompatible encodings
unless you take great care.
Notably, the Sid environment in Debian needs some care when using EMACS.
Also post-7.0 versions of Redhat and Windows XP need some care
since they use Unicode UTF-8 as their default encodings.
</p>
<p>
Do not use Windows as a development environment.
You can of course use a terminal program in Windows to do 
development on a Debian GNU/Linux machine.
I recommend using puTTY as ssh terminal.
Also, the 7th section under 
<url id="http://sf.net/docman/?group_id=1"
name="SourceForge.Net -&gt; Site Docs"> gives many hints for
Windows users. I have to say even 
<url id="http://www.cygwin.com" name="CygWin"> was 
erratic. CygWin editors added funny CR after all lines :-( Bad.
</p>

<sect id="software">Software environment
<p>
I think that it is probably best to use the Sid version
of the debiandoc-sgml package even if you have a Woody system.
However, if you encounter problems then you should go back to the
older version.
TeX is changing a lot from Woody to Sarge, so expect a
rough ride if you update your system.
Use chroot tricks to experiment with these unstable environments.
Please note that Sarge could not be used at the moment (August 2003)
to create Chinese PostScript or pdf files.  I think it is usable
as of now (May 2005).
You need Sid to do this.

<sect id="1step">First steps
<p>
You need a SSL enabled web browser to do the following.
<enumlist>
<item>Join sourceforge.net (=sf.net) and get account name.
<item>Read <url id="http://sf.net/docman/?group_id=1" name="SourceForge.Net -&gt; Site Docs">.
<item>Inform your sf.net account name to the project manager through e-mail.
<item>Wait for your name being added to "qref" developers.
<item><strong>SSL login</strong> to "Personal Page" at sf.net with your account name.
<item>Click "Debian Reference" under "My Projects".
<item>Click "Lists" and proceed to add your e-mail address to "qref-developers".
<item>Set up MUA for "qref-developers". (You can directly access this at
 <url id="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/qref-developers"
name="Qref-developers Info Page">)
</enumlist>
</p>
<p>
<example>
 # apt-get install debiandoc-sgml debiandoc-sgml-doc ssh make
 $ cd /usr/share/doc/debiandoc-sgml-doc/
 $ zless debiandoc-sgml.en.txt.gz
 ...
 $ ssh yourname@qref.cvs.sf.net
 ... (activate CVS account by this)
 $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
 $ cvs -z3 -d :ext:yourname@qref.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/qref co -P qref
 $ cd qref
 ... do what ever to update "Debian Reference"
 $ cvs up
 ... resolve conflicts
 $ cvs ci -m"I did something"
</example>
The "-P" option is used to ensure that empty directories are not created.
</p>
<p> 
If someone adds a new directory you can use <tt>cvs up -d</tt> to obtain this.
</p>
<p>
For web page including this document, check out "htdocs" instead of "qref".
<example>
 $ cvs -z3 -d :ext:yourname@qref.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/qref co htdocs
 ...
</example>
I only update main web pages index.??.php this way.  (I will change this to scp
soon.)
</sect>


<sect id="da">Daily activities
<p>
<list>
<item>Update local archive with latest source (cvs up).
<item>Use mailing list (qref-developers@lists.sf.net) to communicate with others.
<item>Use CVS to update to latest version, etc.
<item>If mistakes exist, correct them. Just make sure you don't make new mistakes! :)
</list>
</p>
<p>
<example>
 $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
 $ cd qref
 $ cvs diff -u -r rev1 -r rev2 [files ...] |less
 ... inspect what others have done
 $ cvs up
 ... edit as you wish
 $ cvs up
 ... resolve conflicts
 $ cvs ci -m"I did something"
</example>
</p>
</sect>

<sect id="cvssg">CVS usage guide
<p>
CVS must be used effectively with an editor.
(Read "Debian Reference" for more info.)
<list>
<item>Go to <url id="http://qref.cvs.sf.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/qref/" name="CVS page"> 
to see what has been recently changed and who did it.
This will give you an idea of which files need attention.
See
<ref id="webdiff">.
<list>
<item>You can get diff information from web with colors.
</list>
<item>Use the CVS diff command to find out exact changes by others.
<item>Try to commit one file at a time with a good description.
<item>Try to set text file width to 72-78 char/line before commit.
<list>
<item>Start vim with $ vi -c "set tw=78" filename
<item>Or even better for translators, use 
"vimdiff -c 'set tw=78' en/file.sgml fr/file.sgml" on 
sideway stretched (160 char/line) x-term.  It is very nice ;-)
<item>Reformat by highlighting with visual mode (V) and "gq" 
only if it is new section (do not do this for old sections).
<item>Start vim with $ vi -c "set tw=78" filename
<item>Also having diff file shown in another window is handy.
</list>
<item>Try to be slow on any structural changes
and consult others.
General guidelines are:
<list>
<item>Do not change filenames.
<item>Do not change line breaks across files.
<item>Do not add new files.
<item>Do not move sections.
<item>Do not add long descriptive sections.   
There should be an alternative which is simpler.
</list>
<item>Try to coordinate with others.
<list>
<item>Ask on the mailing list or ask me.
</list>
<item>Make sure to update referenced version number when translating.
<item>Use comments if needed. &lt;!-- comment words --&gt;
<item>Use switchable comment text for FIXME. &lt;![%FIXME;[Describe issues here ...]]&gt;
<footnote>
To display these FIXME lines, edit default.ent to change 
the definition of FIXME from "IGNORE" to "INCLUDE".
</footnote>
</list>
</p>
<sect id="contents">Choice of contents
<p>
The choice of what shall be included in the document
involves tough decisions.
Let me explain a bit more.
</p>
<p>
Introductions aimed at new Debian users are OK
so long as it is in appropriate chapters such as
system.sgml, tutorial.sgml or support.sgml.
Try to keep them from getting too long.
</p>
<p>
I have no problem fixing factual errors any time
as long as this does not break existing contents.
When you correct, please consider other people's systems.
"It works for me this way" is not a good enough
reason to change the current recommendation.
</p>
<p>
Adding a new section is easier on translators than moving and
reorganizing.
I am not too tough on people requesting addition as long
as it does not bloat too much and writing style meet out standard. 
(No to bloat quick-* applies.) 
<p>
As for section reorganization, I know it is tempting but please avoid it
as much as possible.  Also once a section is started to be translated,
please refrain from too much of stylistic changes and line formating
changes.  These tends to cause confusion to translators.  If you need to
include existing contents, use <tt>&lt;ref id="..."&gt;</tt> to refere
existing contents elsewhere than moving it instead.
</p>
<p>
This guide should be the collection of
<strong>best practices</strong>.
So if there is a bug which needs a workaround,
file a bug report against the package.
If it needs to be mentioned on this document, 
make a link to BTS entry so that when the bug is fixed,
readers have an easy way of finding this out.
Please do not make this document into a collection
of workarounds.
<footnote>
I know some of the current contents fall into category of the work around.  
My point is we need to minimize this kind of contents.
</footnote>
</p>
<p>
If you intend to make major changes,
ask the mailing list and give people 10 days to respond.
</p>
</sect>

<sect id="mlsg">Mailing list communication guide
<p>
Mailing lists must be used effectively.
<list>
<item>Respect threading in the ML and assign a good subject line.
<list>
<item>Use "Reply-to" to the ML when responding to old topic in ML. (list-reply-to)
<item>Try not to use "Reply-to-all" for ML.
<item>New topics must have new title for ML.
<item>Do not create a new topic by clicking "Reply-to" for ML.
</list>
<item>Give people at least 3 days to respond for trivial things.
<item>Give people at least 10 days to respond for important things.
</list>
</p>
</sect>

<sect id="shellag">Sf.net shell account guide
<p>
Shell account gives you access to your home directory and the project web
page. (Please do not worry updating web.  Just drop me a mail after commit.
This is here for reference only.)
<list>
<item>Set umask to be 002 to create files/directories as 664/775 or:
<example>
$ chmod -R g+w *
</example>
<item>You can always remove a file (Be careful though).
<example>
$ cp foo bar
$ rm foo
$ vim bar
$ mv bar foo
</example>
<item>Change content of all CVS/Root content to your account if you want
to update on the same tree.  (You can create new one and move them into
the place too.)
<example>
$ perl -pi -e 's,:osamu@,:yourname@,g' $(find . -path '*/CVS/Root')
</example>
<item>All important files are archived in CVS (htdocs for web page).
<item>Edit web page in CVS locally and update it in shell account.
</list>
<p>
Peek into my home directory for the examples (/home/users/o/os/osamu).
</p>
</sect>


<sect id="upcon">Update contents
<p>
Always use latest file from English as the source of translation.
html, text, ps, and pdf file can be created locally to test your 
SGML:
<example>
$ cd /where/you/have/qref
$ cvs up                       # sync with HEAD
...
$ make clean                   # if file owner is not you
$ make html1 LANGS1=en LANGS2=      # for English for full  html document
$ make html2 LANGS1=en LANGS2=en    # for English for short html document
$ make html  LANGS1=en LANGS2=en    # for English for both  html documents
$ make txt   LANGS1=en LANGS2=en    # for English for both  txt  documents
$ make ps    LANGS1=en LANGS2=en    # for English for both  ps   documents
$ make pdf   LANGS1=en LANGS2=en    # for English for both  pdf  documents
$ make pdf   LANGS1=de LANGS2=de    # for German  for both  pdf  documents
$ make html1 "LANGS1=fr it"         # for French and Italian full html
$ make publish "LANGS1=fr it"       # for French and Italian html to ~/public_html
                  # this emulates what happens on DDP server 
$ make sf         # publish web page to sourceforge.
</example>
</p>
<p>
Last one only works from Osamu's account :-)
<example>
# apt-get install ssh
# apt-get install -t unstable debiandoc-sgml debiandoc-sgml-doc
# apt-get install -t unstable tetex-bin tetex-extra # this may be dangerous
$ cd directory-where-local-qref-exists
$ cvs up                       # sync with HEAD
...
$ export SFUSER=osamu
$ make scp                     # sf page created
</example>
Web page can be synced easily with cvs contents (HEAD) from 
a shell account of <var>yourname</var> as long as you update contents in CVS:
<example>
$ cd /home/groups/q/qr/qref/htdocs/
$ cvs -d:ext:<var>yourname</var>@cvs1:/cvsroot/qref up
...
</example>
Even though anyone can update any sf.net web page or files through
rigourous shell account activity, it may be complicated and error prone.
<p>
Please do not commit file elsewhere and overwrite file here by manually
copying latest version.  It will break merging file.
</p>
</sect>


<sect id="ckout">Check output
<p>
LaTeX is used to create PostScript and .pdf files.  These files contain
hyphenations (such as un-stable) to ensure a proper text width in contrast
to .html or text files.  TeX's algorithm works well on English texts
nevertheless it may create wrong hyphenations such as "files-ystem".
<p>
You can check these in the German translation of the Debian Reference with
<example>
$ make LANGS1=de LANGS2= check-hyphen
</example>
(This requires the hyphen-show package.) The output is written to
reference.de.hyp.  Check this file for wrong strings.  If you don't want to
check this file again and again, you may create
&lt;lang&gt;/validLaTeX.hyphen (copy the .hyp file).  Ensure that all entries
in this file are valid.  The next time you start this hyphen check, the
output and .hyp file are reduced by these and contain only hyphenations
which are (possibly) wrong.
<p>
These words should be written into &lt;lang&gt;/LaTeXmacros.sty with correct
hyphenations.  Please see the German file for an example.  Do another check
after this until the .hyp file stabilizes.
</p>
</sect>


<sect id="roadmap">Roadmap
<p>
Continuous activities:
<enumlist>
<item>Spell and grammar corrections.
<item>Factual corrections.
<item>Experiment with po-debiandoc.
<item>Add/remove some prospectus contents to README.org.
</enumlist>
Structual road map and prerequisite:
<enumlist>
<item>Rebump build script. (anytime soon when Jens is ready.)
<item>Experiment with po-debiandoc. (when someone can add short howto
in this manual and understand what to do.)
<item>Move CVS to debian-doc CVS or alitoh CVS on Debian system. (when
someone can do this.)
<item>Move to docbook-xml. (when this can be done with script automatically
and xml system is much more stable than 10/2003)
</enumlist>
Content growth road map:
<enumlist>
<item>Add standard unix tutorial contents in old debian-guide package
into tutorial.sgml but exclude from quick-*, Do not copy and paste but
just borrow idea and rewrite it as a shorter one.
<item>apache and simple CGI programing. (tune.sgml and program.sgml)
<item>DNS for simple behind firewall LAN. (tune.sgml after mail or
gateway.sgml)
<item>DHCP server for simple behind firewall LAN. (tune.sgml after DNS
or gateway.sgml)
</enumlist>
</p>
<p>
Small contents proposals are always added to README.org as reminder first.  
Once good info accumulates, add to the real content.
</p>
</sect>

<sect id="cvsnew">Start a new translation
<p>
The translated pages have some comment lines to enable nice version 
tracking.  See existing translation for examples.  All of them
starts something like:
<example>
&lt;!-- CVS revision of this document "$Revision: 1.3 $"  --&gt;
&lt;!-- CVS revision of original english document "1.31"  --&gt;
&lt;!--Line width ruler (ruler uses 78 characters)     34567890123456789012345--&gt;
</example>
Only the 2nd line is really needed for the translation (modify it when
necessary) and only the 1st line (created by CVS) is really needed for the
English original.
</p>
<p>
It is very important that the revision number in the second line matches the
revision of the English file, which was used for translation. Using this
approach the translator knows, what parts of the translation need an update,
whenever English files changed.
</p>
<p>
If you are starting from scratch, do the following to create 
template files for your new translation.  Suppose you want a new 
language "bk":
<example>
$ mkdir bk
$ ./bin/doc-copy bk
</example>
You overwrite the existing English contents on the files in "bk" directory 
to create the new real translated files.  
</p>
<p>
You may want to edit a few more files as well (don't hesitate to ask if you
need help):
<list>
<item>translate the website (htdocs module), add the new language code
    to htdocs/index.php for content negotiation
<item>translate the debian-reference manual page
<item>update bin/getdocdate (outputs the date in your preferred format)
<item>select hyphenation patterns in texmf/language.dat
<item>update makeindexhtml
</list>
</p>
</sect>

<sect id="cvsdiff">Check changes (CVS)
<p>
This may not be easy if the translator does not use version tracking
implemented through the comment line in translation files.  
Using these version numbers you can manually check recent contents
change existed or not and what was the change.
<p>
We made this automated with <prgn>doc-check</prgn> script.
A list of outdated files can be obtained with 
<example>
$ bin/doc-check <var>lang</var>
</example>
(replace <var>lang</var> with de, es ,fr, it, ...). 
<p>
Use the -d option to get a diff of english files (you must be online).  
<example>
$ bin/doc-check -d <var>lang</var> <var>subdoc</var>
</example>
(replace <var>subdoc</var> with system, tips, tune, ...). 
<p>
<footnote>
If <prgn>bin/doc-check</prgn> is used with <tt>-w</tt> in this example, it 
removes listing of whitespace changes.  I now do not recommend the use of 
<tt>-w</tt> since some white space changes may be important.  
I changed my mind.
</footnote>
Here is the coplete command syntax.
<example>
bin/doc-check [-d] [-v] [-V] [-e] [-w] [-a|lang [subdoc ...]]
bin/doc-check -h [-e] [-a|lang [subdoc ...]]
      -a: all language
      -d: diff
      -v: verbose on reading each file header
      -V: verbose on diff
      -e: verbose on equal rev file (default=quiet)
      -h: create html page with translation versions in table format
      -w: ignore whitespaces for diff
</example>
<p>
After building source for package or after "<tt>rm README; make
README</tt>", you have the version number table created in
<file>README</file> using this <prgn>doc-check</prgn> script.  That may
give you good idea what chapter is lagging translation.
<p>
Let me show an example of how to use this <prgn>doc-check</prgn> script.
<p>
Let's determine whether the French translation is up to date or not
(start this from qref's base directory):
<example>
$ ./bin/doc-check fr 
Translation delay for fr
tips : 1.46 -&gt; 1.73
</example>
The argument "fr" is the directory of the translation (de, pt-br, ...). It
shows that fr/tips.sgml is outdated. A diff of en/tips.sgml's revision 1.46
against 1.73 is available with option -d (-w is used to ignore white spaces).
</p>
<p>
Check changes in English for Italian as a diff (ignore white spaces):
<example>
$ ./bin/doc-check -d -w it | less
</example>
This lists all changes in original English contents from the days
Italian translation.
<footnote>
In an ideal world, I should have put tag on each split :( and you all
have to use TAG to manage changes.  But that never happened.
</footnote>
</p>
<p>
This may be too much to handle if these are too many changes.  To make
diff on one SGML source, for example <file>tune.sgml</file>:
<example>
$ ./bin/doc-check -d -w it tune| less
</example>
<p>
Alternatively, you can get nice colored diff etc using the version
number and techniques written in
<ref id="webdiff">.
</p>
</sect>

<sect id="webdiff">Check changes (WEB)
<p>
If you have any difficulties using CVS like me for tracking changes, 
use <url id="http://qref.cvs.sf.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/qref/" name="CVS page"> 
on qref.sf.net.  This can be reached by selecting the CVS 
tab on the top of the project page.  Few things to remember: We are working 
on "MAIN" branches.  Latest version is called "HEAD".  The rest should be
no problem using web interface and color to check what as been changed.
</p>
<p>
Make sure to update top lines which record referenced English version.

<sect>Why can I only build in txt and html but not in ps or pdf?
<p>
Usually encoding issue. "konwert" is very useful fixing these using 
any/??-iso1 filter as found in bin/isofix in this tree.  We need files 
to be ISO-8859-1.  Not UTF-8.  Be careful, please.
Also iconv and recode can be used.  One of the following will fix 
UTF-8 into ISO-8859-1.  (See bin/isofix for convert all script)
<example>
 $ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-1 somefile.utf8 -o somefile.sgml
 $ konwert any/de-iso1 somefile.utf8 -o somefile.sgml
 $ recode UTF-8..ISO-8859-1 somefile.sgml
</example>


<sect>EMACS and ISO-8859-1 / UTF-8 problem.
<p>
To set language mode,
<example>
(set-language-environment "Latin-1")
</example>
may help you in such a case.  And more, writing
<example>
-*-coding: iso-8859-1;-*-
</example>
should fix it.
<p>
Also you can force emacs to save in iso-8859-1 in making :
<example>
 C-x RET c

<sect>VIM and UTF-8 problem.

See <url id="http://wiki.debian.org/UTF8vimE">.

<sect>Translation version check.
<p>
If you use doc-copy to create starting template and translate them into
any language, you can check version by doc-check.  Even if you did not 
use doc-copy, you can still do version check as long as header (See French
translation for example) are maintained in the same format.

<sect>Translation guide line
<p>
Read as much Debian web site and other translations to make sure wording 
are consistent with current convention.
<p>
Please do not forget to update bin/getdocdate if you add support for a new
language.  Also add manual page.
<p>
Tree name consists of lowercase and hyphen only without underscore.
<example>
 Good: pt-br zh-cn
 Bad: pt_BR zh_CN
</example>

<sect>How to add language specific content.
<p>
If it involves no new chapter/section/paragraph/item/ tags, just 
sneak in anything.
<p>
For example I think addition of:
(NdT: Pour les francophones, vous trouverez de l'aide en vous abonnant à 
 la liste de discussion francophone 
 debian-user-french-request@lists.debian.org.) 
is good :-)
<p>
If you need additional chapter, talk to everyone for your intent.
Think twice before reorganizing chapters and sections.  It will screw up
translation badly.  So be very careful about content addition.
<p>
If you make change to a small point, please make sure to
change sources of all languages and update version tracking
information, if possible.
<p>
I need to hear from readers.  Please e-mail me your opinion or
join as a <url id="http://qref.sf.net" name="qref.sf.net"> developer.  See
<ref id="roadmap"> for the action plan.


<chapt id="change">Recent changes
<p>
There were major changes since early days:
<list>
<item>Many new languages: Polish (pl), Chinese (zh-tw, zh-cn) with
consistent file structure.
<p>pt/ was renamed to pt-br/, please do a "cvs up -d -P" or a new cvs 
checkout if you do not have the pt-br directory.
Qref is now much more consistent than older versions.
<item>David updated STYLESHEET.en, please read it! (Woody, Sarge, Sid is used 
for distribution codenames instead of woody, &lt;tt&gt;sarge&lt;/tt&gt;, "sid", ...; 
keystrokes such as Alt-F3 are not anymore embedded in &lt;tt&gt; tags)
<p>
Most of the changes are stylistic ones according to STYLESHEET.en, but 
also the usage of tags (&lt;tt&gt;, &lt;prgn&gt;, &lt;file&gt;) is now more consistent
<item>There are few new files.  Follow what Jens does for German translation.
Do not forget to copy LaTeXmacros.sty, hyperref-full.cfg, hyperref-quick.cfg,
and validLaTeX.hyphen in your language directory.  Also translate
manual page as debian-reference.<var>lang</var>.1 .
</list>
<p>
There were so many minor changes that it's very likely that we forgot to 
change minor parts of the document. Please report or fix these!
AGAIN, please report everything which seems to be wrong in the english 
files!!!
<p>
I suggest that you use .ps or .pdf output files for proofreading. These 
formats causes the most problems!
<p>
The Makefile uses a new LaTeX format file with much more supported 
hyphenation patterns. Older versions were restricted to English, German, 
and French. There was no support for Polish, Spanish, Italian, Finnish.
(Chinese doesn't use hyphenations.)
<p>
Nevertheless it's likely that .ps or .pdf files contain wrong 
hyphenations such as files-
ystem (instead of file-system).
<p>
You can check all these hyhenations using
$ make check-hyphen1-de
(this requires the hyphen-show package).
<p>
1 stands for Debian Reference, 2 for Quick Reference. Replace "de" with 
your language code.
<p>
The Polish output contains 589 hyphenations, I expect that at least 5% 
are wrong:
<example>
$ wc -l reference.*.hyp | sort -nr
    589 reference.pl.hyp
    337 reference.es.hyp
    306 reference.pt-br.hyp
    252 reference.fr.hyp
    205 reference.it.hyp
    191 reference.en.hyp
     91 reference.zh-tw.hyp
     49 reference.de.hyp
     25 reference.zh-cn.hyp
</example>
If you don't want to check these hyphenations again and again you can 
copy all valid ones to <var>.lang.</var>/validLaTeX.hyphen. I used this for the 
German translation, that's the reason that reference.de.hyp is nearly 
empty (I'm not sure about 49 hyp.).
All wrong hyphenations can be fixed according to de/LaTeXmacros.sty.
