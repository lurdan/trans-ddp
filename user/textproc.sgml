<heading>What this chapter covers</heading>
<p>
This chapter tells you how to do text processing with Debian GNU/Linux.
<p>
We assume that you are already able to write simple text files with a
text editor like <prgn>vi</prgn>. The available text editors are described in
<ref id="editors">.</p>

<heading>Text processing</heading>
<p>
Text processing means that you write the contents of a document as simple
ASCII text with additional commands which describe the structure of your
document. Then you start the text processor. The text processor converts the
document source into a document with layout. This document may contain
mathematical formulas, tables, figures, etc.</p>
<p>
The most important text processor in the Debian GNU/Linux system is LaTeX.
Other text processors are TeX, the basis of LaTeX, and groff.</p>
</sect>

<sect>LaTeX
<p>
LaTeX is a very powerful and thus very complex macro package for the TeX
typesetting system. In this section it is only possible to give a simple
example of text processing with LaTeX. Our goal is to show the principle
ideas and how to invoke LaTeX with Debian GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>
To use LaTeX, you should install the packages <tt>tetex-base</tt>,
<tt>tetex-bin</tt>, <tt>tetex-doc</tt>, and <tt>tetex-extra</tt>.</p>
<sect1>Invoking LaTeX
<p>
The following text is a simple example of a LaTeX document.
<example>
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is a test text for \LaTeX .
\LaTeX\ is a very complex macro package
built on the \TeX -typesetting system.

\TeX was created for the high quality
typesetting of mathematical formulas 
\begin{equation}
c^2=a^2+b^2
\end{equation}
like this one.
\end{document}
</example>
Write this text with your favourite editor and save it as
<tt>Testtext.tex</tt>. Then type <tt>latex Testtext</tt>. This
should create a file <tt>Testtext.dvi</tt>. This is the resulting
text in a device independent file format. To view this text
type <tt>xdvi Testtext</tt>. This creates the necessary text fonts,
if they are not already available. These fonts are saved, so there
will be no delay next time.</p>
</sect1>
<sect1>Printing dvi-files
<p>
To print the document, you can translate the dvi-file into a ps-file
by typing <tt>dvips -o Testtext.ps Testtext</tt>. This creates a file
<tt>Testtext.ps</tt>. This file can be inspected with <tt>gv</tt> which
is included in the Debian package <tt>gv</tt>. If you have set up your
printer to print ps-files, you can just type <tt>lpr Testtext.ps</tt> to
get a hardcopy of our example.</p>
<p>
How to set up your printer is described in the Debian GNU/Linux System
Administrator's Manual.</p>
</sect1>
<sect1>Documentation on LaTeX
<p>
If you have installed the package <tt>tetex-doc</tt>, you will find the
documentation below the directory <tt>/usr/lib/texmf/doc</tt>. An excellent
introduction to LaTeX which should be sufficient in many cases is
<tt>/usr/lib/texmf/doc/latex/general/lshort2e.dvi</tt>.</p>
<p>
LaTeX supports typesetting in many different languages. This is covered by
<tt>/usr/lib/texmf/doc/generic/babel/user.dvi</tt>.</p>
<p>
You may also find examples of LaTeX-documents in the package
<tt>diploma</tt>.
