"Debian supports an ever-increasing number of natural languages.  Even if you "
"are a native English speaker and do not speak any other language, it is part "
"of your duty as a maintainer to be aware of issues of internationalization "
"(abbreviated i18n because there are 18 letters between the 'i' and the 'n' "
"in internationalization).  Therefore, even if you are ok with English-only "
"programs, you should read most of this chapter."

"(internationalization) means modification of a software or related "

"implementation of a specific language for an already internationalized "

"l10n and i18n are interconnected, but the difficulties related to each of "
"them are very different.  It's not really difficult to allow a program to "
"change the language in which texts are displayed based on user settings, but "
"it is very time consuming to actually translate these messages.  On the "
"other hand, setting the character encoding is trivial, but adapting the code "
"to use several character encodings is a really hard problem."
