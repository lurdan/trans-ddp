"The rationale for using helper scripts in <filename>debian/rules</filename> "
"is that they let maintainers use and share common logic among many "

"<filename>/usr/lib/menu</filename> for executable binary menufiles, if this "
"is needed), and add commands to the maintainer scripts to register and "
"unregister the menu entries.  Since this is a very common thing for packages "
