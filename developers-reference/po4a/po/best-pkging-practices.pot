"The rationale for using helper scripts in <filename>debian/rules</filename> "
"is that they let maintainers use and share common logic among many "
"packages.  Take for instance the question of installing menu entries: you "
"need to put the file into <filename>/usr/share/menu</filename> (or "
"<filename>/usr/lib/menu</filename> for executable binary menufiles, if this "
"is needed), and add commands to the maintainer scripts to register and "
"unregister the menu entries.  Since this is a very common thing for packages "
"to do, why should each maintainer rewrite all this on their own, sometimes "
"with bugs? Also, supposing the menu directory changed, every package would "
"have to be changed."

"<xref linkend=\"tools\"/> contains a couple of different helpers.  The most "
"common and best (in our opinion) helper system is <systemitem "
"role=\"package\">debhelper</systemitem>.  Previous helper systems, such as "
"<systemitem role=\"package\">debmake</systemitem>, were monolithic: you "
"couldn't pick and choose which part of the helper you found useful, but had "
"to use the helper to do everything.  <systemitem "
"role=\"package\">debhelper</systemitem>, however, is a number of separate "
"little <command>dh_*</command> programs.  For instance, "
"<command>dh_installman</command> installs and compresses man pages, "
"<command>dh_installmenu</command> installs menu files, and so on.  Thus, it "

"It is up to a package's maintainer whether to create a debug package or "
"not.  Maintainers are encouraged to create debug packages for library "
"packages, since this can aid in debugging many programs linked to a "
"library.  In general, debug packages do not need to be added for all "
"programs; doing so would bloat the archive.  But if a maintainer finds that "
"users often need a debugging version of a program, it can be worthwhile to "
"make a debug package for it.  Programs that are core infrastructure, such as "
"apache and the X server are also good candidates for debug packages."

"Some debug packages may contain an entire special debugging build of a "
"library or other binary, but most of them can save space and build time by "
"instead containing separated debugging symbols that <command>gdb</command> "
"can find and load on the fly when debugging a program or library.  The "
"convention in Debian is to keep these symbols in "
"<filename>/usr/lib/debug/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>, where "
"<replaceable>path</replaceable> is the path to the executable or library.  "
"For example, debugging symbols for <filename>/usr/bin/foo</filename> go in "
"<filename>/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/foo</filename>, and debugging symbols for "
"<filename>/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</filename> go in "
"<filename>/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</filename>."

"The debugging symbols can be extracted from an object file using "

"the path to the debugging symbol file.  <citerefentry> "
"<refentrytitle>objcopy</refentrytitle> <manvolnum>1</manvolnum> "
