"When you know how you want to contribute to &debian-formal;, you should get "
"in contact with existing Debian maintainers who are working on similar "
"tasks.  That way, you can learn from experienced developers.  For example, "
"if you are interested in packaging existing software for Debian, you should "
"try to get a sponsor.  A sponsor will work together with you on your package "
"and upload it to the Debian archive once they are happy with the packaging "
"work you have done.  You can find a sponsor by mailing the "
"&email-debian-mentors; mailing list, describing your package and yourself "
"and asking for a sponsor (see <xref linkend=\"sponsoring\"/> and <ulink "
"url=\"&url-mentors;\"></ulink> for more information on sponsoring).  On the "
"other hand, if you are interested in porting Debian to alternative "
"architectures or kernels you can subscribe to port specific mailing lists "
"and ask there how to get started.  Finally, if you are interested in "
"documentation or Quality Assurance (QA) work you can join maintainers "
"already working on these tasks and submit patches and improvements."
