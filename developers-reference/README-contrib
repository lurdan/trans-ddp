* Contacting

To contain the maintainers of this package, email
<developers-reference@packages.debian.org>.


* Contributing

If you want to contribute to the Developer's Reference, it's best to
first submit a few patches as bug reports.  Writing patches for
existing bugs are also always appreciated.  You may wish to make
patches against the SVN sources, about which see below.

When making changes, please try to use short lines of text (< 64
characters). This makes it easier to use 'diff' to see the
differences. (See discussion in <http://bugs.debian.org/278267>)

Do not commit patches to the developers reference yourself unless
authorized to do so. Patches need to be finalized and common opinion
before they are applied. This is even true if you happen to have
SVN access for other reasons.


* Writing style

Please use gender-neutral formulations. This means avoiding
pronouns like he/she when referring to a role (like "maintainer")
whose gender is unknown. Instead of you should use the
plural form (singular they [1]).

* SVN

If you're interested in ongoing maintenance, once you've shown that
you've mastered the style of the manual with a couple accepted
patches, you can be given SVN access. If you already have
access to the SVN server for other reasons, do not use it unless
authorized to do so.

This manual is a part of the Debian Documentation Project (DDP).
Information about SVN access for DDP can be found at
<http://www.debian.org/doc/cvs>.

If you just want to check out the current SVN version of this
manual to create patches against, you can use the following
command to do so:

svn co svn://svn.debian.org/ddp/manuals/trunk/developers-reference


* Translators

We have tried to keep language-independant bits of text in common.ent.
Feel free to truck stuff out of the English manual into common.ent if
it's useful, or else report the problem.

The translation PO files are in po4a/po/, we hope very much for more
translations.
