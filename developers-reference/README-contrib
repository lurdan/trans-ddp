* Contacting

To contain the maintainers of this package, email
<developers-reference@packages.debian.org>.


* Contributing

If you want to contribute to the Developer's Reference, it's best to
first submit a few patches as bug reports.  Writing patches for
existing bugs are also always appreciated.  You may wish to make
patches against the SVN sources, about which see below.

Do not commit patches to the developers reference yourself unless
authorized to do so. Patches need to be finalized and common opinion
before they are applied. This is even true if you happen to have
SVN access for other reasons.


* SVN

If you're interested in ongoing maintenance, once you've shown that
you've mastered the style of the manual with a couple accepted
patches, you can be given SVN access. If you have already
access to the SVN server for other reasons, do not use it unless
authorized to do so.

Instructions on how to get the SVN version of this software, including
how to get SVN access, can be found at
<URL:http://svn.debian.org/>.


* Translators

We have tried to keep language-independant bits of text in common.ent.
Feel free to truck stuff out of the English manual into common.ent if
it's useful, or else report the problem.

The translation .po files are in po4a/fr/ and po4a/ja/ for French and
Japanese. We hope very much for more translations.
