NMU -- sec "Source NMUs and the Bug Tracking System" should talk about
changelog entries -- dinstall works that out depending on whether the
maintainer in the control and changelog match.

From DWN:

Debian's newest server is klecker.debian.org, which is now serving as
Debian's main web server. Of course, it's named after Joel "Espy"
Klecker. Unfortunately, many home directories from the old
va.debian.org machine, which suffered a disk failure, have still not
been recovered and may be gone for good. A new hostname,
people.debian.org has also been set up, "which will exclusively be
used for individual web pages". Developers with personal Debian web
pages should begin using URLs based on the new domain name.
