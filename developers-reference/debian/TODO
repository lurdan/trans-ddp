NMU -- sec "Source NMUs and the Bug Tracking System" should talk about

<aph> Robot101: do you have a URL describing new incoming system?
<Robot101> http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2002/debian-devel-announce-200202/msg00006.html

talk about sponsoring, http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/sponsor/ ?
or should that be in the new maintainers guide only?

<buxy> we'll be able to include a blurb about the PTS in the Resources part
<buxy> we just need to wait the text from the guy who proposed his help
<buxy> We need to think about other "simplifications" too
<buxy> for example, all that stuff about upload queues is mostly useless
<buxy> annoucing package uploads is no more necessary since it's done by katie itself
