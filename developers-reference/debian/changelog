developers-reference (2.7.2) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

    (closes: Bug#52582, Bug#48926)
  * debian/rules: fix build error caused by newer debiandoc-sgml; remove

developers-reference (2.5.0) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * move to 3-level version number:
    top-level version number probably won't change for a while, it is the
    "major", the second-level number means significant content changes,
    and the third-level change means corrections and minor improvements.
    Since this version has significant content changes, we are now 2.5.0.
    Since I'm going to put porter instructions in the next major rev, that
    will be 2.6.0...

  * use new <package> tag where appropriate (Ardo, you rock)
  * replace 'm86k' with 'm68k'
  * rename 'Whirlwind Tour of ...' section to 'Overview of ...' (suggested 
    by James Troup)
  * typos and "red-pen" corrections, fix cosmetic problems in PostScript
    version
  * remove the one case I use an URL fragment identifier, since
    debiandoc-sgml doesn't like it (bug filed against debiandoc-sgml)
  * debian/rules: cosmetic cleanups, loosen check for root
  * debian/rules: build PostScript version during build, since it's nice
    to have all my debiandoc2* scripts together
  * debian/control: policy compliant to 2.5.0

  * advise against uploading when a package has lintian problems of
    severity 'E'
  * "Mailing Lists and Servers":
    - "The master server": mention how master is the home of the BTS;
      mention how users need to take care with their accounts on master
    - "The WWW servers": fill in www.debian.org, first pass, and discuss
      how to put up your own web pages on va or master
    - "The CVS server": new section added
    - "Mirrors of Debian servers": new section added; point to info about
       how to mirror
  * "Applying to Become a Maintainer": do not advise resending initial
    application; instead, simply mail a followup asking new maintainers
    whether they go the initial application (closes Bug #28739); mention
    that calls usually come in the evening; mention that if you use PGP
    v5, you need to generate an RSA key (right?); clarify our intentions
    with respect to GPG.
  * "Release code names": Debian 2.2 is 'potato'
  * "Distribution directories": give concrete examples, hopefully making
    it clearer where to look in Debian archives for specific stuff;
    mention that old distributions are moved to archive servers (is there
    a canonical location?)
  * "The override file": new section, added under "Notification that a new
    package has been installed"; fill it out quite a bit
  * "Uploading to *": reiterate thrice not to upload export
    controlled-software to master, or the European queues on erlangen and
    chiark
  * "Picking a distribution": section broken out from "Generating the
    changes file"
  * "Uploading to frozen": new section, almost straight from Brian White
    (hope you don't mind!) -- isn't that topical?
  * "Interim releases": if you NMU a new upstream version (0.1), run 
    'dpkg-buildpackage -sa'

developers-reference (2.4.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix instructions for new maintainers, incorporating the actual text
    sent to prospective new maintainers.  Improve this text a bit for
    readability, coverage, and organization.  Significant changes were
    patched back to the new-maintainers group, if they care to use
    them. (closes Bug#26948)
  * Add an introductory "Scope" chapter which helps delineate what should
    and should not be included in this Reference.
  * Add a new chapter, "Whirlwind Tour of Debian Maintainer Tools".  Let
    me know what useful tools I forgot -- remember, Debian-specific
    maintainer tools only!
  * Add discussion of the "experimental" distribution, culled from an email
    from Guy Maor on debian-devel.
  * Incorporated suggestions from Branden Robinson (closes Bug#27211).
  * Point to doc-debian's mailing list instructions where relevant.
  * Made references to online documentation into URLs where possible.
  * Little corrections here and there.
  * add a Makefile for use in the DDP manual hierarchy
  * debian/rules: comment out my 'source-depends' hack; it's just slowing
    things down

developers-reference (2.4.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * fill in Section "The master server" a bit; other servers to follow

    are always in 'dists' subdir of the Debian archive; talk about
    'proposed-updates'
  * in Section "Release code names", talk about 'sid' a bit
  * in Section "Interim releases", talk about how non-maintainers should
    use the BTS, and bug severity "fixed" (closes Bug#17524)
  * in Section "Generating the changes file", talk about how to set the
    distribution in the debian/changelog file (i.e., "frozen unstable")
  * add a new Section "Checking the package prior to upload" to Section
    "Uploading a package", mentioning lintian and other tests one should
    do prior to uploading

    in Section "Uploading a package", talking about dinstall and the
    override file a bit
  * add new Sections "Moving packages", "Removing packages", "Replacing or
    renaming packages", and "Orphaning a package" (closes Bug#26650)
  * add new Section "Bugs in your packages", talking about maintainer
    duties with respect to bugs
  * add new Section "Lintian reports" under "Handling bugs reports",
    talking about how maintainers should check their packages with lintian 
    every now and then, alternatively pointing them to the lintian web
    pages
  * clarify, a bit, the use of "section" and "subsection", bringing it
    into line with the usage in the Policy Manual and Packaging Manual
  * grammar and markup changes throughout
  * debian/rules: added a crude source-depends rule, which renders more
    explicit what is used to build this package

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jul 1998 00:52:35 -0400

developers-reference (2.4.1.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * non-maintainer release
  * rebuilt since HTML versions of Chapters 1 and 2 were truncated
    (important bug, no number yet, bugs.debian.org isn't working;
    regardless, this should go in hamm because a broken developers
    reference won't win us many friends in hamm, and after all, it's just
    text, it can't hurt you.)
  * no content changes, except that the version number in the SGML file
    reflect this packages version number
  * debian/rule: clean is cleaner now

  * Orphaned package

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Thu, 14 May 1998 21:56:36 +0200

developers-reference (2.4.1.0) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New version numbering scheme:
  
    - The version numbers are independent of dpkg now, but all policy
      manuals (the Debian Policy Manual, the Debian Packaging Manual, and
      the Debian Developer's Reference) share the same version numbering
      scheme.
    
    - The first three digits of the version number specify the
      `Standards-Version.' This number is incremented with each policy
      change. The fourth digit represents the `patch-level,' which may
      differ between the manuals. 
  
      If only the patch-level digit is incremented, no changes in policy
      have been made, except bug fixes and clarifications. Packages only
      have to specify the first three digits of the version number in the
      `Standards-Version' field of their source packages.
  
  * Uploaded to frozen and unstable. This is a documentation-only
    package and the changes to the manual are relevant for hamm.

  * No changes to the Developer's Reference

    - New chapter 5 Handling bug reports:
      + when reporting more then 10 bugs on the same topic, a message
