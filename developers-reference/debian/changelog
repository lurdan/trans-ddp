  * new maintainer
  * version number and date are automatically populated now

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Jul 1998 17:30:11 -0400

developers-reference (2.4.1.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * non-maintainer release
  * rebuilt since HTML versions of Chapters 1 and 2 were truncated
    (important bug, no number yet, bugs.debian.org isn't working;
    regardless, this should go in hamm because a broken developers
    reference won't win us many friends in hamm, and after all, it's just
    text, it can't hurt you.)
  * no content changes, except that the version number in the SGML file
    reflect this packages version number
  * debian/rule: clean is cleaner now

  * Orphaned package

developers-reference (2.4.1.0) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New version numbering scheme:
  
    - The version numbers are independent of dpkg now, but all policy
      manuals (the Debian Policy Manual, the Debian Packaging Manual, and
      the Debian Developer's Reference) share the same version numbering
      scheme.
    
    - The first three digits of the version number specify the
      `Standards-Version.' This number is incremented with each policy
      change. The fourth digit represents the `patch-level,' which may
      differ between the manuals. 
  
      If only the patch-level digit is incremented, no changes in policy
      have been made, except bug fixes and clarifications. Packages only
      have to specify the first three digits of the version number in the
      `Standards-Version' field of their source packages.
  
  * Uploaded to frozen and unstable. This is a documentation-only
    package and the changes to the manual are relevant for hamm.

  * No changes to the Developer's Reference
