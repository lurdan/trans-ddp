<chapt>Introduction -- What is the Debian Project?

<p><url id="http://www.debian.org" name="The Debian Project">
is a collection of volunteers who endeavor to produce the Debian 
GNU/Linux software distribution,  a distribution of Linux currently
available for Intel and Motorola 68000 machines.  Sparc,  UltraSparc,  
MIPS,  and PowerPC distributions are under development,  and support
for the Alpha architecture is anticipated in the upcoming 2.1 release.
Debian is the major thrust of Software In The Public Interest,  Inc., 
a New York-based non-profit organization dedicated to the spread of 
free software (also called "Open Source Software").  

<p>For more information about free software, see the <url id="http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html" name="Debian Social Contract">. and <url id="http://www.debian.org/intro/free" name="The Debian Free Software Guidelines">.

<chapt>Debian Releases

<p>Debian 0.01 through 0.90 (August-December 1993)

<p>Debian 0.91 (January 1994):  this release had a simple package system
which could install and uninstall packages.  The project had grown to several
dozen people at this point.

<p>Debian 0.93R5 (March 1995):  By now,  each developer had responsibility
for a package or packages,   and the package manager (<prgn>dpkg</prgn>) was
used to install packages after the installation of a base system.

<p>Debian 0.93R6 (November 1995):  <prgn>dselect</prgn> appears.  This will be
the last a.out Debian release;  there are now about 60 developers.

<p>Debian 1.1 <em>Buzz</em> (June 1996):  This appears to be the first
Debian release with a code name (taken,  like all others,  from the movie
<em>Toy Story</em>);  this is probably because it was also the first
release made after Bruce Perens took over leadership of the Project from
Ian Murdock.  This release was fully ELF,  used Linux kernel 2.0,  and 
contained 474 packages.

<p>Debian 1.2 <em>Rex</em> (December 1996):  848 packages,  120 developers.

<p>Debian 1.3 <em>Bo</em> (July 1997):  974 packages, 200 developers.

<p>Debian 2.0 <em>Hamm</em> (July 1998):  First Debian release to support
the Motorola 68000 series architectures.  This release (the first made
under Ian Jackson as Project Leader) made the transition to libc6,  and had
1500+ packages and 400 developers.

<chapt>A Detailed History

<sect>The 0.x Releases

<p>
Debian was begun in August 1993 by Ian Murdock,  then an undergraduate
at Purdue University.  Debian
was sponsored by the GNU Project of <url id="http://www.fsf.org" name="The Free Software Foundation">,  the organization started by Richard Stallman
and associated with the General Public License (GPL),  for one year --
from November 1994 to November 1995.

<p>
Debian 0.01 through Debian 0.90 were released between August and December
of 1993.  Ian Murdock writes:

<p>
"Debian 0.91 was released in January 1994.  It had a primitive package
system that allowed users to manipulate packages but that did little
else (it certainly didn't have dependencies or anything like that).
By this time, there were a few dozen people working on Debian, though
I was still mostly putting together the releases myself.  0.91 was
the last release done in this way.

<p>
Most of 1994 was spent organizing the Debian Project so that others
could more effectively contribute, as well as working on dpkg (Ian
Jackson was largely responsible for this).  There we no releases to
the public in 1994 that I can remember, though there were several
internal releases as we worked to get the process right.

<p>
Debian 0.93 Release 5 happened in March 1995 and was the first
"modern" release of Debian: there were many more developers by then
(though I can't remember exactly how many), each maintaining their own
packages, and dpkg was being used to install and maintain all these
packages after a base system was installed.

<p>
Debian 0.93 Release 6 happened in November 1995 and was the last a.out
release.  There were about sixty developers maintaining packages in
0.93R6.  If I remember correctly, dselect first appeared in 0.93R6."

<p>
Mr. Murdock also notes that Debian 0.93R6 "... has always been my favorite
release of Debian",  although he admits to the possibility of some personal
bias,  as he stopped actively working on the project in March 1996 during
the pre-production of Debian 1.0, which was actually released as Debian 1.1.

<p>
An early member of the project,  Bill Mitchell,  remembers the linux
kernel 

<p>
"... being between 0.99r8 and 0.99r15 when we got started. For a long time,
I could build the kernel in less than 30 minutes on a 20 Mhz 386-based 
machine, and could also do a debian install in that same amount of time in
 under 10Mb of disk space.

<p>
" ... I recall the initial group as including Ian Murdock, myself,
Ian Jackson, another Ian who's surname I don't recall, Dan Quinlan, and some
other people who's names I don't recall. Matt Welsh was either part of the
initial group or joined pretty early on (he has since left the project).
Someone set up a mailing list, and we were off and running. 

<p>
As I recall, we didn't start off with a plan, and we didn't start off by
putting together a plan in any highly organized fashion. Right from the
start, I do recall, we started off collecting up sources for a pretty random 
collection of packages. Over time, we came to focus on a collection of items
which would be required to put together the core of a distribution:  
the kernel, a shell, update, getty, various other programs and support
files needed to init the system, and a set of core utilities." 

<sect1>The Early Debian Packaging System 

<p>
At the very early stages of the Project, members considered distributing
source-only packages. Each package would consist of the upstream source
code and a Debianized patch file, and users would untar the sources, apply
the patches, and compile binaries themselves. They soon realized, however,
that some sort of binary distribution scheme would be needed. The earliest
packaging tool, written by Ian Murdock and called dpkg, created a package
in a Debian-specific binary format, and could be used later to unpack and
install the files in the package. 

<p>
Ian Jackson soon took over the development of the packaging tool, renaming
the tool itself <prgn>dpkg-deb</prgn> and writing a front-end program he named 
<prgn>dpgk</prgn> to facilite the use of <prgn>dpkg-deb</prgn> and provide the
<em>Dependencies</em> and <em>Conflicts</em> of today's Debian system. The
packages produced by these tools had a header listing the version of the
tool used to create the package and an offset within the file to a
<prgn>tar</prgn>-produced archive, which was seperated from the header by some
control information. 

<p>
At about this time some debate arose between members of the project -- some
felt that the Debian-specific format created by <prgn>dpkg-deb</prgn> should
be dropped in favor of the format produced by the <prgn>ar</prgn> program.
After several revised file formats and correspondingly-revised packaging tools,
the <prgn>ar</prgn> format was adopted. 
</sect1>

<sect>The 1.x Releases

<p>
When Ian Murdock left Debian, he appointed Bruce Perens as the next leader
of the project. Mr. Perens first became interested in Debian while he was 
ttempting to create a Linux distribution CD to be called "Linux for Hams",
which would include all of the Linux software useful to ham radio operators.
Finding that the Debian core system would require much further work to
support his project, Mr. Perens ended up working heavily on the base Linux
system and postponing his ham radio distribution, including organizing 
(with Ian Murdock) the first set of Debian install scripts, eventually
resulting in today's Debian Rescue Floppy. 

<p>
Mr. Murdock states: 

<p>
"Bruce was the natural choice to succeed me, as he had been maintaining the 
base system for nearly a year, and he had been picking up the slack as the
amount of time I could devote to Debian declined rapidly." 

<p>
He initiated several important facets of the project, including coordinating
the effort to produce the Debian Free Software Guidelines and the Debian
Social Contract, and the initiation of <url id ="http://www.openhardware.org" name="The Open Hardware Project">. During his time as Project Leader, Debian
gained market share and a reputation as a platform for serious,
technically-capable Linux users. 

<p>
Mr. Perens also spearheaded the effort to create <url id="http://www.spi-inc.org" name="Software in the Public Interest,  Incorporated">. Originally intended 
to provide the Debian Project with a legal entity capable of accepting 
donations, its aims quickly expanded to include supporting free software
projects outside the Debian Project. 

<p>
The following Debian versions were released during this time: 

<p>
<list>
<item>1.1 <em>Buzz</em> released June 1996 (474 packages, 2.0 kernel, fully ELF, dpkg)
<item>1.2 <em>Rex</em> released December 1996 (848 packages, 120 developers)
<item>1.3 <em>Bo</em> released July 1997 (974 packages, 200 developers)
</list>

<p>
There were several interim "point" releases made to 1.3,  with the last being 
1.3.1R6.

<p>
Bruce Perens was replaced by Ian Jackson as Debian Project Leader at
the beginning of January,  1998,  after leading the project much of the
way through the preparation for the 2.0 release.
</sect>

<sect>The 2.x Releases

<p>
Ian Jackson became the Leader of the Debian Project at the beginning of
1998,  and was shortly thereafter added to the board of Software in the
Public Interest in the capacity of Vice President.  After the resignation
of the Treasurer (Tim Sailer),  President (Bruce Perens),  and 
Secretary (Ian Murdock),  he became President of the Board and three new 
members were chosen:  Martin Schulze (Vice President), Dale Scheetz 
(Secretary),  and Nils Lohner (Treasurer).

Debian 2.0 (<em>Hamm</em>) was released July 1998 for the Intel i386 and
Motorola 68000 series architectures.  This release marked the move to a new
version of the system C libraries  (libc6 or glibc2). At the time of release,  
there were 1500+ packages maintained by more than 400 Debian developers.
</sect>

<sect>What's Next?

<p>
The Debian developers are currently working on Debian 2.1,  which has been 
code-named <em>Slink</em>.  This version will include some support for the new 
Linux File Hierarchy Standard,  a new user interface to the package
maintenance system (called <prgn>apt</prgn>),  and <url id="http://www.gnome.org" name="Gnome">,  the Gnu Network Object Model Environment.
